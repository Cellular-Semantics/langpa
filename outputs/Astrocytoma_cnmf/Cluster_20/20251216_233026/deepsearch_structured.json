INSM1 drives expression of downstream transcription factors and effector genes that prevent terminal differentiation while maintaining stem-like self-renewal capacity. This program hijacks developmental transcriptional networks normally governing the transition between radial glia and differentiating neurons, instead using them to sustain malignant progenitor-like identity. Multiple direct and indirect targets of INSM1 are present in the gene list, creating a coordinated transcriptional program that maintains cellular plasticity and stemness.",

In normal neurons, SRRM4 expression increases during neural development and directs the production of neuronal-specific exons in hundreds of target genes. In astrocytomas, SRRM4 enables production of neuronal isoforms despite the maintenance of undifferentiated progenitor-like transcriptional identity, creating cells with a chimeric phenotype combining progenitor transcription patterns with neuronal protein isoforms. This uncoupling of transcriptional identity from translational output enhances cellular plasticity and enables rapid phenotypic switching.",

        "description": "Astrocytomas maintain comprehensive cell adhesion machinery including cadherins, contactins, neurexins, and ephrin-EphB signaling systems. These adhesion systems serve dual roles: (1) enabling formation of cohesive tumor tissues through organized junctional structures, and (2) facilitating interactions between tumor cells and surrounding neural tissue including neurons and microglia. Classical cadherins and their associated catenins link cells through adherens junctions, while immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecules like contactins and neurexins mediate both homophilic cell-cell interactions and interactions with diverse binding partners. The spatial organization of these adhesion molecules likely contributes to the architecture of the tumor microenvironment.",

        "description": "Astrocytomas maintain sophisticated signaling networks downstream of Rho family GTPases that regulate cytoskeletal organization, cell morphology, and migration. PAK (p21-activated kinase) proteins including PAK3 and PAK5, alongside RND3 (RhoE), function as key effectors of Rho GTPase signaling. These proteins regulate actin dynamics, focal adhesion assembly, and cell-cell junctions. The presence of GTPase regulatory proteins (FGD4, RAPGEF5) indicates active GTPase signaling. Rho GTPase signaling is particularly important in enabling the morphological plasticity that allows astrocytoma cells to transition between migratory and stationary phenotypes.",

Programs are ranked by significance score reflecting the number of supporting genes, breadth of pathway coverage, and strength of evidence for dysregulation in astrocytoma context."
