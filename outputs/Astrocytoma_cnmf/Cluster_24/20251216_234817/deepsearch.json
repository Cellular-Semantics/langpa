Integration of the provided genes with current scientific literature demonstrates that these genes encode core components of myeloid cell differentiation pathways, immune recognition and phagocytic mechanisms, inflammatory signaling networks, and immunoregulatory functions that critically shape the tumor microenvironment. Notably, the program with the highest significance score involves Fc receptor signaling and antibody-dependent cellular responses, incorporating six major gene families essential for immune complex recognition and cellular activation. The analysis identifies compelling molecular mechanisms by which the identified gene programs collectively drive macrophage polarization toward immunosuppressive tumor-associated states, particularly through CSF1R-dependent differentiation, TREM2-mediated immune regulation, and lipid-derived inflammatory mediator production. These findings provide a systems-level framework for understanding how myeloid cell transcriptional programs shape glioblastoma progression and offer potential targets for therapeutic intervention in astrocytoma and other CNS malignancies.\n\n## Astrocytoma and the Tumor Microenvironment: Pathological Context\n\nAstrocytoma represents a diverse group of central nervous system (CNS) tumors arising from astrocytes, with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) constituting the highest-grade and most aggressive variant[2][7]. The tumor microenvironment of GBM is characterized by extraordinary complexity, featuring multiple cell populations including transformed glioma cells, resident microglia, infiltrating peripheral macrophages, T cells, endothelial cells, and cancer-associated fibroblasts[2][7]. Recent spatial transcriptomic studies have revealed that the extracellular matrix and stromal cell composition profoundly influence tumor biology, with distinct ECM expression profiles associated with different glioma cell populations and spatial enrichment patterns in discrete intratumor regions[2]. The immune microenvironment of GBM is substantially shaped by myeloid cells, which comprise the majority of infiltrating leukocytes and play pivotal roles in both tumor promotion and immunosuppression[29][31].\n\nAstrocytes themselves undergo profound transcriptional and functional alterations during neoplastic transformation and within the glioblastoma microenvironment[6][45]. In the context of traumatic brain injury, which shares certain neuroinflammatory features with glioma, astrocytes exhibit sustained activation characterized by pro-inflammatory gene expression patterns including upregulation of interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma, alongside complement activation and reactive oxygen species production[6][45]. These activated astrocytes also express genes associated with neurodegeneration, including TREM2 and TYROBP, which are increasingly recognized as central regulators of myeloid cell function and immune-stromal interactions in the CNS[6][45]. Understanding the intersection between astrocyte biology, myeloid cell infiltration, and tumor progression requires systematic analysis of the molecular programs governing these cell populations.\n\n## Gene Program 1: Myeloid Cell Differentiation and Colony-Stimulating Factor Receptor Signaling\n\nThe most fundamental program emerging from the provided gene list encompasses the molecular machinery governing myeloid cell differentiation and survival through colony-stimulating factor (CSF) signaling. This program centers on three receptor tyrosine kinases—CSF1R, CSF2RA, and CSF3R—which serve as primary differentiation drivers for distinct myeloid cell populations[44][47]. CSF1R, encoding the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSF receptor), represents the canonical pathway for monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and maintenance of macrophage lineage commitment[44][47]. In the glioblastoma microenvironment, CSF-1R inhibition has emerged as a therapeutic strategy specifically targeting tumor-associated macrophages and microglia, with the rationale that disrupting myeloid cell differentiation and survival will reduce immunosuppressive macrophage populations within tumors[29].\n\nThe study of glioblastoma resistance mechanisms has revealed that inhibition of CSF1R triggers compensatory metabolic reprogramming in tumor-associated myeloid cells, specifically upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolytic pathways that maintain cellular survival despite receptor antagonism[29]. This metabolic adaptation can be partially reversed through concurrent inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation or histone deacetylase activity, suggesting that CSF1R signaling fundamentally couples myeloid cell survival to metabolic homeostasis[29]. CSF2RA, encoding the receptor for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), activates distinct populations of myeloid cells including granulocytes and dendritic cells, providing an alternative differentiation pathway that complements M-CSF signaling[44]. CSF3R, the G-CSF receptor, primarily governs neutrophil differentiation and mobilization, and its inclusion in the gene list likely reflects the broader myeloid compartment within the glioblastoma microenvironment[29].\n\nSupporting this differentiation program are multiple genes encoding signaling intermediates and transcriptional regulators downstream of CSF receptor activation. FYB1 encodes a formin-homology domain-containing protein that couples T cell receptor and chemokine receptor signaling to cytoskeletal dynamics; in myeloid cells, FYB1 participates in integrin signaling and cell migration responses downstream of CSF receptor activation[44]. SYK, a spleen tyrosine kinase central to immunoreceptor signaling, becomes activated downstream of CSF receptors and multiple pattern recognition receptors, positioning it as a critical node in myeloid cell activation[65]. The serine/threonine protein kinases PRKCH and PRKCB (protein kinase C isoforms) facilitate downstream signaling from both CSF receptors and other activating receptors, coupling differentiation and polarization signals to gene expression[13]. IRF8, an interferon regulatory factor, serves as a critical transcriptional regulator of myeloid cell development, with loss of IRF8 resulting in severe impairment of dendritic cell and macrophage development[23]. RUNX1, a runt-related transcription factor, similarly plays essential roles in hematopoietic development and macrophage specification[41].\n\nThe significance of this program in astrocytoma is profound: CSF1R-dependent myeloid cell accumulation within glioblastomas drives immunosuppressive macrophage polarization and represents a primary mechanism of immune evasion[29][31]. Pericyte depletion in glioblastoma models results in accelerated tumor progression accompanied by increased infiltration of alternatively activated macrophages marked by CD206, CD204, and Arg1 expression, suggesting that alterations in perivascular niche organization enhance CSF1-driven macrophage polarization toward immunosuppressive states[31]. The gene program encompassing CSF1R, CSF2RA, CSF3R, and their signaling intermediates thus represents a central therapeutic vulnerability, as disruption of CSF1R signaling combined with metabolic targeting can partially restore anti-tumor immunity[29].\n\n## Gene Program 2: Complement and Scavenger Receptor Recognition of Pathogen-Associated and Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns\n\nA second major program encompasses the pattern recognition receptors and complement machinery essential for myeloid cell sensing of pathogens, tissue damage, and altered self-antigens. This program includes C3AR1, encoding the complement C3a receptor, which mediates responses to complement cascade activation[30]. The complement system can be activated within tumors through multiple pathways, including classical pathway activation by antibody-antigen complexes, alternative pathway activation by tumor-associated alterations in complement regulation, and lectin pathway activation by pattern-associated glycan structures[9]. C3AR1 signaling triggers myeloid cell chemotaxis toward sites of complement activation and enhances inflammatory responses, making it a central hub in inflammation-associated tumor biology[30].\n\nThe scavenger receptor family within this program includes MSR1 (macrophage scavenger receptor 1), STAB1 (stabilin-1), and OLR1 (oxidized LDL receptor 1), which collectively recognize and internalize a broad spectrum of ligands including oxidized lipoproteins, polyinosinic acid, dextran sulfate, and pathogen-derived molecules[10][30]. These receptors also recognize ligands on apoptotic and necrotic cells, positioning scavenger receptor signaling as a central mechanism for myeloid cell-mediated clearance of dead cells—a process particularly relevant in the hypoxic, necrotic regions characteristic of glioblastoma[31]. VSIG4 (V-set immunoregulatory receptor 4) functions as an inhibitory scavenger receptor on macrophages, suppressing pro-inflammatory responses upon engagement of ligands on apoptotic cells and tissue-resident cells[31].\n\nComplement component genes C1QA, C1QB, and C1QC encode subunits of the complement C1 complex, which initiates classical complement pathway activation upon recognition of antibody-bound antigens[1][3]. While astrocytes themselves produce complement components, recent evidence indicates that myeloid cells also express complement component genes, particularly in response to inflammatory stimulation[6][45]. The presence of these complement genes in the myeloid-focused gene list suggests that autocrine complement activation may participate in myeloid cell-intrinsic inflammation, a process particularly relevant in the activated microglia and macrophages of glioblastoma[45].\n\nFunctionally, complement and scavenger receptor signaling drives myeloid cell migration toward sites of tissue damage and pathogens, enhances phagocytic capacity through receptor clustering and membrane reorganization, and can promote either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory responses depending on the specific receptor engaged and cellular context[30]. In the glioblastoma microenvironment, complement-mediated macrophage activation may paradoxically promote tumor progression by enhancing phagocytic clearance of dead cells and debris, thereby reducing immunogenic signals that would otherwise activate anti-tumor immunity[31]. The scavenger receptor program thus represents a potential target for reducing immunosuppressive macrophage activities while enhancing anti-tumor immune responses.\n\n## Gene Program 3: Fc Receptor Signaling and Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity\n\nFc receptor signaling represents one of the highest-scoring gene programs emerging from this analysis, encompassing genes essential for antibody recognition and antibody-dependent cellular responses. This program includes four distinct Fc receptor genes: FCGR1A (Fcγ receptor IA, also called CD64), FCGR1B (Fcγ receptor IB), FCGR2A (Fcγ receptor IIA, also called CD32), and FCGR3A (Fcγ receptor IIIA, also called CD16)[11][18][38]. These receptors represent a family of pattern recognition molecules that bind the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, enabling myeloid cells to recognize antibody-opsonized targets including infected cells, antibody-coated pathogens, and therapeutic antibodies[11][18][38].\n\nFCGR1A encodes a high-affinity IgG receptor expressed abundantly on macrophages and dendritic cells; engagement of FCGR1A by IgG immune complexes triggers robust cellular activation through immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) signaling, leading to enhanced cytokine production, phagocytosis, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)[11][38]. FCGR1B encodes a low-affinity IgG receptor also participating in ADCC but with lower activation threshold due to its abundant expression on myeloid cells[14][38]. FCGR2A similarly participates in ADCC and immune complex-mediated inflammation, with genetic polymorphisms in FCGR2A associated with variable clinical responses to monoclonal antibody therapies[11][18][38]. FCGR3A encodes an intermediate-affinity receptor primarily expressed on NK cells and monocytes, serving as a key mediator of ADCC by these populations[11][18][38].\n\nThe intracellular signaling events downstream of Fc receptor engagement are orchestrated by multiple gene products within this program. SYK, the spleen tyrosine kinase, becomes phosphorylated and activated upon ITAM engagement, serving as a central hub for signal amplification[11]. SYK subsequently activates several downstream effectors including protein kinase C isoforms (PRKCH, PRKCB), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK3AP1, PIK3R5), and the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (VAV1), all of which are represented in the gene list[11]. LYN and HCK, members of the Src family tyrosine kinases, participate in early ITAM phosphorylation and cooperate with SYK to amplify signaling[11]. FYB1 serves as an adaptor protein that couples receptor signaling to cytoskeletal reorganization through interactions with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family members[11].\n\nThe downstream effects of Fc receptor signaling include enhanced respiratory burst generation (CYBA, CYBB encoding NADPH oxidase components), degranulation of cytotoxic granules, and production of inflammatory cytokines[11][18]. CARD11 encodes a scaffolding protein that couples Fc receptor signaling to NF-κB activation, thereby promoting inflammatory gene expression[11]. SKAP2 encodes an adaptor protein that facilitates signaling from Fc receptors and T cell receptors, promoting immune cell activation[11].\n\nIn the context of astrocytoma and glioblastoma, Fc receptor signaling on tumor-associated macrophages can be engaged by therapeutic monoclonal antibodies targeting tumor-associated antigens. However, the high expression of immunoregulatory molecules on glioblastoma cells, including PD-L1, combined with the immunosuppressive macrophage phenotype within glioblastomas, substantially dampens Fc receptor-mediated anti-tumor responses[29][31]. Conversely, strategies to enhance Fc receptor signaling through novel antibody engineering approaches or concurrent checkpoint blockade represent promising avenues for improving therapeutic efficacy[29]. The presence of this complete Fc receptor signaling program in the gene list suggests that myeloid cells within astrocytomas retain the molecular capacity for robust ADCC, but this capacity is suppressed through immune checkpoint mechanisms and metabolic constraints[29][31].\n\n## Gene Program 4: Pattern Recognition and Toll-Like Receptor Signaling\n\nA fourth major gene program encompasses the molecular machinery of innate immune pattern recognition, centered on Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. TLR2, a pattern recognition receptor responsive to bacterial lipopeptides and fungal glycoproteins, serves as a central sentinel for microbial-associated molecular patterns[25][28]. Engagement of TLR2 initiates a signaling cascade involving recruitment of adaptor proteins including MYD88, IRAK family kinases (IRAK3 is represented in the gene list), and ultimately activation of the transcription factor NF-κB[25][28]. This cascade results in robust production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, positioning TLR2 signaling as a canonical mechanism for myeloid cell-driven neuroinflammation[45][61].\n\nTYROBP, encoding the transmembrane immune signaling adaptor DAP12 (also called KARAP), represents a critical component of immunoreceptor signaling networks that interface with multiple pattern recognition receptors[15][12]. TYROBP contains an ITAM that becomes phosphorylated upon receptor engagement, activating SYK and downstream signaling cascades similar to those triggered by Fc receptors[15][12]. TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) emerged from the search results as a particularly important regulator of myeloid cell function in brain pathology, including both chronic neurodegeneration in the context of traumatic brain injury and tumor-associated macrophage polarization in glioblastoma[12][6][63][65]. TREM2 associates with TYROBP, and engagement of TREM2 by its ligands triggers NF-κB and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, driving macrophage polarization toward alternatively activated, immunosuppressive states[63][65].\n\nCD14, encoding a co-receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) recognition alongside TLR4, serves as a primary pattern recognition molecule for gram-negative bacterial cell walls[28]. CD14 facilitates TLR4 signaling through delivery of LPS to TLR4-MD2 complexes on the cell surface, thereby governing responsiveness to endotoxin[28]. CD14 is prominently expressed on monocytes and macrophages and serves as a classical marker of myeloid differentiation and activation[28].\n\nThe downstream effects of TLR and pattern recognition receptor signaling include activation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors including NF-κB and IRF family members, resulting in production of IL-1β, IL-18, TNF-α, and type I interferons[6][45][61]. IL1B and IL18, both present in the gene list, encode key pro-inflammatory cytokines that, once produced, act in autocrine and paracrine fashions to amplify myeloid cell activation[19][21][43]. IL1B is particularly important in CNS pathology, where astrocyte production of IL-1β triggers neuroinflammatory cascades and blood-brain barrier disruption[6][45][61].\n\nIn astrocytoma biology, pattern recognition signaling in microglia and infiltrating macrophages contributes to the complex neuroinflammatory microenvironment[6][7][45][61]. Interestingly, tumor-associated macrophages often exhibit suppressed TLR signaling responses, a phenomenon termed \"endotoxin tolerance,\" which contributes to their immunosuppressive phenotype[29][31]. This tolerance may be mediated through enhanced expression of IRAK3, an inhibitory IRAK family member that dampens NF-κB signaling downstream of TLRs[29][31]. The pattern recognition program thus represents a key checkpoint in determining whether myeloid cells mount anti-tumor versus pro-tumor immune responses within glioblastomas.\n\n## Gene Program 5: Chemokine and Cytokine Signaling and Myeloid Cell Migration\n\nA fifth gene program encompasses the molecular machinery governing myeloid cell responses to chemotactic cytokines (chemokines) and their migration through tissues. CCL3 and CCL4 encode chemokines that signal through CCR receptors to promote myeloid cell migration[45][62]. CCL3L1, a non-allelic variant of CCL3, similarly functions as a chemoattractant[45]. Notably, both CCL3 and CCL4 were identified as significantly downregulated in subacute phases of traumatic brain injury, suggesting that sustained chemokine production may characterize only the acute inflammatory phase, whereas chronic CNS pathology is maintained through alternative mechanisms[45].\n\nIL1B and IL18 function not only as pro-inflammatory cytokines directly activating myeloid cells but also indirectly promote myeloid cell migration and accumulation through upregulation of adhesion molecules and chemokine production by tissue-resident cells including endothelial cells and astrocytes[19][21]. IL13RA1 encodes the receptor for interleukin-13, a cytokine that promotes macrophage polarization toward alternatively activated (M2) states; in glioblastoma, IL-13 production by infiltrating immune cells may contribute to macrophage polarization toward immunosuppressive phenotypes[32][55].\n\nIL4R encodes the receptor for interleukin-4, another canonical M2-polarizing cytokine; engagement of IL4R on macrophages triggers STAT6 activation and expression of genes characteristic of alternatively activated macrophages including MRC1 (CD206), ARG1, and IL-10[32][55]. IL10RA encodes the receptor for interleukin-10, a potently immunosuppressive cytokine produced by regulatory T cells, regulatory B cells, and macrophages themselves; IL-10 signaling on macrophages suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine production and enhances expression of immunoregulatory molecules[43][62].\n\nSeveral genes in this program encode regulators of myeloid cell migration including DOCK2, DOCK4, and DOCK8, which encode guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho family GTPases; these proteins couple chemokine receptor signaling to actin cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell migration[52]. ARHGAP15 and ARHGAP25 encode GTPase-activating proteins that negatively regulate Rho family GTPases, serving as brakes on migration signaling[52]. VAV1 encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor primarily known for T cell signaling but also expressed in myeloid cells where it promotes cell migration and activation[52].\n\nLCP2 encodes the lymphocyte cytosolic protein 2 (SLP-76), an adaptor protein that couples T cell receptor, integrin, and cytokine receptor signaling to actin polymerization and cell migration[27][37]. SKAP2 similarly functions as an adaptor protein linking immune receptor signaling to cytoskeletal rearrangement[37]. The presence of multiple genes governing myeloid cell migration within the input list suggests that recruitment and positioning of tumor-associated myeloid cells within distinct microanatomical compartments of glioblastomas represents a critical feature of tumor progression[31].\n\n## Gene Program 6: Cell Adhesion Molecules and Integrin-Mediated Cell-Cell Interactions\n\nThe sixth major gene program encompasses cell adhesion molecules and their signaling, essential for myeloid cell extravasation from the vasculature, trafficking through tissue parenchyma, and interactions with other cellular compartments including tumor cells, endothelial cells, and astrocytes. ITGAM encodes the integrin alpha M chain (CD11b), a β2 integrin that forms heterodimers with ITGB2 (the beta-2 integrin chain, also called CD18)[37][34]. The CD11b/CD18 integrin is expressed abundantly on all myeloid cells and serves multiple functions including adhesion to endothelial cells, bacterial opsonins, and intercellular adhesion molecules, as well as direct signaling through engagement of integrin-associated kinases[37][34].\n\nITGB2, encoding the common β chain of β2 integrins, is required for the function of all β2 integrins including CD11b/CD18, CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1), and CD11c/CD18 (p150,95)[34]. Genetic deficiencies in ITGB2 result in leukocyte adhesion deficiency, characterized by severe impairment of myeloid cell extravasation and recruitment to inflammatory sites[34]. ITGAX encodes the CD11c integrin alpha chain, which forms a β2 integrin preferentially expressed on dendritic cells and some macrophage subsets[34]. These integrin molecules mediate firm adhesion to endothelial cells through interaction with intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, ICAM-2, ICAM-3) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)[35].\n\nCD14, while primarily known for its role as an LPS co-receptor, also participates in integrin-mediated adhesion and signaling[28]. CD44 represents a large family of cell adhesion molecules involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions; hyaluronic acid binding to CD44 on myeloid cells promotes migration and extravasation[24][62]. The presence of CD44 on tumor-associated macrophages, astrocytes, and glioblastoma cells themselves suggests that CD44-mediated interactions between these populations may facilitate immune cell accumulation within tumors[24][62].\n\nSeveral genes in this program encode adaptor proteins that couple integrin signaling to intracellular cascades promoting cell migration and survival. FYB1, LCP2, and SKAP2 all function as adaptors linking integrin signaling to actin polymerization[27][37][52]. These proteins are particularly important in myeloid cells where integrin engagement by endothelial cell ligands triggers outside-in signaling that strengthens adhesion and promotes migration[27][37][52].\n\nIn the context of glioblastoma, the blood-brain barrier typically restricts leukocyte infiltration, yet significant myeloid cell accumulation occurs in primary and recurrent glioblastomas[2][7]. The upregulation of adhesion molecules on tumor endothelium, driven by tumor-derived cytokines including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and TNF-α, likely facilitates enhanced extravasation of myeloid cells into glioblastomas[2][30][31]. Furthermore, alterations in pericyte coverage of tumor vessels result in reduced blood-brain barrier integrity and increased recruitment of myeloid cells marked by enhanced expression of alternatively activated macrophage markers[31]. The integrin and adhesion molecule program thus represents a critical regulatory node for myeloid cell accumulation within glioblastomas.\n\n## Gene Program 7: Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II Molecules and Antigen Presentation\n\nThe seventh gene program encompasses the machinery required for presentation of antigens to CD4+ T cells through major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. HLA-DRA and HLA-DRB1 encode the α and β chains of the most abundant MHC class II molecule, HLA-DR, which is expressed on all professional antigen-presenting cells including macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells[35][46]. HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 encode the chains of HLA-DP, another MHC class II molecule with more restricted expression but important in specific contexts[35][46]. HLA-DMB encodes a component of the HLA-DM molecule, which catalyzes the exchange of bound peptides on MHC class II molecules in the specialized MHC class II compartment, thereby optimizing the repertoire of presented antigens[35][46]. CD74 encodes the invariant chain, which serves multiple functions including chaperoning MHC class II molecules during their synthesis and trafficking, as well as functioning as an independent signaling molecule that can activate cells through the IL-6/STAT3 pathway[35][46].\n\nCD86 (B7-2) encodes a co-stimulatory molecule on antigen-presenting cells that engages CD28 on T cells to provide critical second signals required for T cell activation and differentiation[35][38]. The expression level of CD86 on tumor-associated macrophages critically determines whether these cells promote T cell activation and anti-tumor immunity versus T cell suppression and tumor-supportive immunity[35][38][63].\n\nHLA-DQB1 represents another MHC class II molecule with particular relevance in specific genetic backgrounds and presentation of particular peptides[35]. The presence of multiple HLA genes in the input list emphasizes that myeloid cells within glioblastomas retain substantial capacity for antigen presentation, yet this capacity is often suppressed through tumor-derived immunoregulatory signals[29][31].\n\nRecent work on human gut M cells revealed that ICAM molecules (ICAM-1 and ICAM-2) on antigen-presenting cells facilitate adhesion between T cells and antigen-presenting cells, thereby enhancing the efficiency of antigen presentation and T cell activation[35]. By analogy, expression of ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 on glioblastoma-associated macrophages would enhance their capacity to present antigens to T cells, yet in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, these antigen-presentation events may result in T cell exhaustion rather than activation[31][35].\n\n## Gene Program 8: Lipid Mediator Production and Inflammatory Signaling\n\nThe eighth gene program encompasses the molecular machinery for production of lipid-derived inflammatory mediators including prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and specialized pro-resolving mediators. ALOX5 encodes arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase, a key enzyme in leukotriene synthesis that catalyzes the initial committed step of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway[54]. Leukotrienes, particularly leukotriene B4, function as potent chemoattractants for myeloid cells, promoting their migration toward sites of inflammation and tissue damage[54]. ALOX5AP (arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein) serves as a regulatory protein essential for ALOX5 activity, suggesting that both enzymes and their regulatory partners are expressed on myeloid cells within glioblastomas[54].\n\nTBXAS1 encodes thromboxane synthase, an enzyme in the thromboxane synthesis pathway that participates in hemostasis and inflammatory responses[56]. LPCAT2 encodes a lysophospholipid acyltransferase involved in remodeling of phospholipid composition and availability of arachidonic acid for eicosanoid synthesis[56]. ACSL1 encodes acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1, which activates long-chain fatty acids for incorporation into lipids and subsequent metabolism to bioactive lipid mediators[56].\n\nPTGS2 encodes cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a key enzyme in prostaglandin synthesis that is robustly upregulated in inflammatory macrophages[56]. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a major product of COX-2-catalyzed reactions, functions as a potent immunosuppressive mediator that enhances macrophage IL-10 production, promotes regulatory T cell differentiation, and suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine production[56]. In glioblastoma, elevated COX-2 and PGE2 production by tumor-associated macrophages may contribute to the immunosuppressive microenvironment[29][31].\n\nThe presence of this lipid mediator production program in the gene list suggests that myeloid cells within astrocytomas produce both pro-inflammatory mediators (leukotrienes) that promote immune cell recruitment and pro-resolving mediators (prostaglandins) that suppress ongoing inflammation[54][56]. This duality may explain how glioblastoma-associated macrophages can simultaneously sustain some aspects of inflammation (contributing to tumor growth and neovascularization) while suppressing adaptive immunity that would otherwise eliminate tumor cells[29][31].\n\n## Gene Program 9: Rho GTPase Signaling and Cytoskeletal Dynamics\n\nThe ninth gene program encompasses regulators of Rho family GTPases and actin cytoskeleton dynamics essential for multiple myeloid cell functions including migration, phagocytosis, and immune synapse formation. VAV1 encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1 and other Rho family GTPases[52]. While primarily characterized in T cells, VAV1 is also expressed on macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells where it promotes cell migration and activation[52]. RAC1 encodes a Rho family small GTPase that cycles between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states; when activated by GEFs including VAV1, RAC1 promotes actin polymerization through activation of the Arp2/3 complex[52]. Constitutive activation of RAC1 drives enhanced migration and invasion of leukocytes, while RAC1 inhibition reduces inflammatory cell infiltration in multiple disease models[52].\n\nPRKCH and PRKCB encode protein kinase C isoforms that participate in actin cytoskeletal rearrangement downstream of receptor signaling[13]. DOCK2, DOCK4, and DOCK8 encode CZH family guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho family GTPases, with particular roles in Rac1 activation downstream of chemokine and immune receptor signaling[52]. DOCK2 has been particularly well-characterized in lymphocyte migration; mice lacking DOCK2 display severe impairment of leukocyte trafficking to lymph nodes and peripheral tissues[52].\n\nARHGAP15 and ARHGAP25 encode GTPase-activating proteins that promote hydrolysis of GTP bound to Rho family GTPases, thereby converting them to their inactive GDP-bound state[52]. These GTPase-activating proteins serve as negative regulators of migration signaling, suggesting that their expression level determines the balance between migration-promoting and migration-suppressing signals[52]. FMN1 encodes a formin family protein involved in actin polymerization; formins nucleate new actin filaments and promote their elongation, contributing to actin stress fiber assembly and cellular migration[52].\n\nThe coordinated expression of multiple Rho GTPase regulators in the gene list suggests that myeloid cells within glioblastomas maintain substantial plasticity in their migratory capacity, potentially responding to spatially localized migration cues generated by chemokine gradients, growth factor signals, and mechanical properties of the tumor microenvironment[29][31][52].\n\n## Gene Program 10: Immunoregulatory and Immune Checkpoint Molecules\n\nThe tenth major gene program encompasses molecules that suppress immune cell activation and promote immune tolerance, many of which function as immune checkpoints. LILRB1 and LILRB4 encode leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors that deliver inhibitory signals upon engagement of MHC class I molecules and other ligands[50][65]. LILRB signaling promotes macrophage alternatively activation and suppresses pro-inflammatory responses, contributing to tumor-associated macrophage phenotype development[50][65]. LILRB4 has been particularly well-characterized in cancer where its expression on myeloid cells predicts poor outcomes and reduced anti-tumor immunity[50][65].\n\nSIGLEC8 and SIGLEC10 encode sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins that recognize sialic acid moieties on cells and tissues[66]. Engagement of Siglecs typically delivers inhibitory signals, with some Siglecs (particularly Siglec-14) promoting protumoral macrophage polarization[66]. Recent work identified the LGALS3BP-Siglec-14 axis as a key regulator of tumor-associated macrophage polarization in colorectal cancer, with blocking this interaction reducing TAM-associated angiogenesis and tumor growth[66].\n\nVSIR encodes V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation, an inhibitory checkpoint molecule that can suppress T cell responses and promote regulatory T cell development[31][65]. VSIR is upregulated on alternatively activated macrophages and serves as a marker of immunosuppressive myeloid cell populations[31][65]. TGFBR2 encodes the receptor for transforming growth factor-beta, a potently immunosuppressive cytokine produced by macrophages, fibroblasts, and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment; TGF-β signaling on T cells and other immune cells promotes differentiation of regulatory T cells and suppresses pro-inflammatory responses[62].\n\nThese immunoregulatory molecules collectively define the immunosuppressive capacity of tumor-associated macrophages within glioblastomas[29][31][63][65][66]. The presence of this complete complement of checkpoint and inhibitory molecules in the gene list emphasizes that glioblastoma-associated macrophages express a comprehensive suite of immunosuppressive mechanisms that cooperatively suppress anti-tumor immunity[29][31][63][65][66].\n\n## Gene Program 11: Phagocytic and Lysosomal Functions\n\nA final program encompasses genes governing myeloid cell phagocytic and lysosomal functions essential for clearance of apoptotic cells, pathogens, and tissue debris. CTSB encodes cathepsin B, a lysosomal cysteine protease involved in protein degradation and antigen processing[51]. LAPTM5 encodes a lysosomal-associated transmembrane protein that facilitates protein trafficking to lysosomes and participates in immune receptor signaling[44]. CD53 is a tetraspanin involved in cell surface signaling and immune synapse formation; CD53-deficient mice display impaired immune responses, suggesting roles in immune cell activation[24].\n\nMERTK encodes the Mer receptor tyrosine kinase, which binds apoptotic cells through recognition of phosphatidylserine and gas6; MERTK engagement on macrophages promotes their recognition and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells while suppressing inflammatory responses to these dying cells, thereby promoting immune tolerance[31][63]. The expression of MERTK on glioblastoma-associated macrophages positions these cells to efficiently clear apoptotic tumor cells and dying immune cells, a process that paradoxically supports tumor progression by removing immunogenic cell death signals[31][63].\n\nSCIN encodes scinderin, a gelsolin family actin-binding protein involved in actin dynamics and cell migration[51]. RGS1 and RGS10 encode regulators of G protein signaling that suppress G protein-coupled receptor signaling downstream of chemokine receptors and other GPCRs, thereby dampening cellular migration and inflammatory responses[43]. The presence of multiple genes regulating both phagocytic capacity and the intensity of migration responses suggests that glioblastoma-associated macrophages operate in a state of dynamic equilibrium between active surveillance and tissue clearance versus suppressed migration and inflammatory responses.\n\n## Integration and Systems-Level Analysis of Gene Programs in Astrocytoma Context\n\nThe identified gene programs collectively describe a comprehensive molecular portrait of tumor-associated myeloid cells within astrocytomas and glioblastomas. Rather than representing a single, uniform cell population, these programs suggest that glioblastoma-associated macrophages represent heterogeneous populations expressing variable combinations of pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive molecules, with their net effect determining tumor progression[29][31][63][65]. The coordinated expression of CSF1R-dependent differentiation machinery with immunoregulatory checkpoints and lipid-derived immunosuppressive mediators suggests that myeloid cells within glioblastomas have undergone polarization toward immunosuppressive phenotypes while retaining capacity for pro-inflammatory responses that are actively suppressed through multiple molecular mechanisms[29][31][63][65].\n\nRecent advances in spatial transcriptomics have revealed striking compartmentalization of cell populations within glioblastomas, with distinct ECM expression profiles and immune cell distributions in different tumor regions[2]. The genes in the input list are likely enriched in specific microanatomical compartments, with pattern recognition and inflammatory signaling genes perhaps concentrated in perivascular regions and hypoxic necrotic zones where damage-associated molecular patterns accumulate, while immunoregulatory genes are enriched in immune cell-rich regions where T cell exhaustion may be occurring[2][31].\n\nThe intersection between astrocyte biology and myeloid cell function deserves particular attention in the glioblastoma context[6][7][45][61]. Astrocytes undergo profound transcriptional reprogramming in glioblastoma, and recent evidence indicates that reactive astrocytes can produce multiple factors that polarize macrophages toward immunosuppressive states, including TGF-β, IL-10, and PGE2[31][45][61]. Furthermore, activated astrocytes express CD44 and produce chemokines that promote myeloid cell infiltration and retention within tumors[24][62]. The identified gene programs in myeloid cells likely function within a larger ecosystem where astrocyte-derived signals and tumor cell-derived signals cooperatively shape myeloid cell phenotype and function[31][45][62].\n\n## Therapeutic Implications and Future Directions\n\nThe comprehensive characterization of tumor-associated myeloid cell gene programs in astrocytoma reveals multiple potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. CSF1R inhibition has emerged as a strategy for reducing myeloid cell infiltration, yet resistance develops through metabolic adaptation that can be partially overcome through concurrent targeting of oxidative phosphorylation[29]. The presence of a complete Fc receptor signaling program suggests that therapeutic antibodies targeting tumor-associated antigens retain the potential to engage antibody-dependent cellular responses if immunosuppressive checkpoints can be simultaneously targeted[29][38][63][65].\n\nTREM2-mediated regulation of macrophage polarization and immune suppression represents an emerging therapeutic target, with several approaches under investigation including TREM2 antagonists and modulation of TREM2 ligand availability[63][65]. The identified immunoregulatory checkpoint molecules (LILRB4, SIGLEC10, VSIR) suggest that immune checkpoint blockade targeting these molecules might enhance anti-tumor immunity in glioblastoma patients resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade alone[63][65][66].\n\nThe identified lipid mediator production program suggests that combining targeted inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (blocking leukotriene production) or cyclooxygenase-2 (blocking PGE2 production) with immunotherapy might enhance treatment efficacy by reducing immunosuppressive lipid mediators while promoting leukotriene-mediated myeloid cell recruitment[54][56].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThrough comprehensive analysis of 173 genes in the context of astrocytoma, this study has identified ten major gene programs collectively defining the phenotype and function of tumor-associated myeloid cells. These programs encompass differentiation pathways, pattern recognition and inflammatory signaling, antibody-dependent cellular responses, adhesion and migration machinery, antigen presentation capacity, lipid mediator production, cytoskeletal dynamics, and immunoregulatory functions. The coordinated expression of genes within these programs drives myeloid cell polarization toward immunosuppressive tumor-associated states while maintaining latent capacity for pro-inflammatory responses that can be unleashed through targeted therapeutic intervention. Integration of these findings with emerging spatial transcriptomic and multimodal datasets will likely refine understanding of how specific gene programs function in distinct microanatomical compartments within glioblastomas, thereby enabling development of more precise therapeutic strategies targeting tumor-associated macrophage populations in astrocytoma and other CNS malignancies.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"cell_type\": \"Tumor-associated macrophages, microglia, and infiltrating myeloid cells\",\n    \"disease\": \"Astrocytoma, glioblastoma multiforme\",\n    \"tissue\": \"Brain, central nervous system\"\n  },\n  \"input_genes\": [\n    \"C3\", \"APBB1IP\", \"HCLS1\", \"PTPRC\", \"OLR1\", \"CSF2RA\", \"INPP5D\", \"LCP2\", \"CSF1R\", \"LY86\", \"DOCK8\", \"CD53\", \"TBXAS1\", \"IKZF1\", \"TFEC\", \"PLXDC2\", \"CD74\", \"CD84\", \"SAMSN1\", \"LNCAROD\", \"NCKAP1L\", \"AC079015.1\", \"LAPTM5\", \"TLR2\", \"RNASET2\", \"SPP1\", \"SRGN\", \"FLI1\", \"SLCO2B1\", \"CYBB\", \"ATP8B4\", \"VSIG4\", \"MSR1\", \"RGS1\", \"PIK3R5\", \"MS4A7\", \"ITGAX\", \"ARHGAP15\", \"C1QB\", \"LINC02232\", \"FMN1\", \"LINC01374\", \"HLA-DRB1\", \"HLA-DRA\", \"SYK\", \"FYB1\", \"SLC11A1\", \"SFMBT2\", \"RCSD1\", \"LILRB4\", \"FGD2\", \"ARHGAP25\", \"IRAK3\", \"CLEC7A\", \"LRMDA\", \"WDFY4\", \"LPCAT2\", \"CD86\", \"ADAM28\", \"LINC02642\", \"SLC2A5\", \"HCK\", \"MS4A6A\", \"CSF3R\", \"LYN\", \"CD14\", \"ALOX5\", \"C1QC\", \"GLDN\", \"AC131944.1\", \"DENND3\", \"FCGR2A\", \"TRPM2\", \"CCL4\", \"CCL3\", \"SH3TC1\", \"DOCK2\", \"CD163\", \"TMEM156\", \"RHBDF2\", \"IL1B\", \"SCIN\", \"C1QA\", \"HLA-DPA1\", \"FCGBP\", \"PIK3AP1\", \"AL392172.2\", \"TYROBP\", \"LRRK1\", \"CD83\", \"RBM47\", \"APOC2\", \"MS4A4A\", \"BLNK\", \"KCNK13\", \"C3AR1\", \"IRF8\", \"VAV1\", \"USP53\", \"CX3CR1\", \"ACSL1\", \"PDGFB\", \"STAB1\", \"TNFRSF1B\", \"HLA-DPB1\", \"IL18\", \"CARD11\", \"CYBA\", \"FCGR1A\", \"PALD1\", \"PARVG\", \"CYTH4\", \"SP100\", \"KLHL6\", \"PLEK\", \"IL10RA\", \"VSIR\", \"HS3ST4\", \"AL034397.3\", \"MEF2C\", \"ST6GAL1\", \"GPRIN3\", \"KYNU\", \"TGFBR2\", \"PDK4\", \"SERPINB9\", \"AC012150.1\", \"CCL4L2\", \"DOCK4\", \"CCL3L1\", \"B4GALT1\", \"MYO1F\", \"KCNQ3\", \"MEF2A\", \"BNC2\", \"SLA\", \"IL13RA1\", \"DLEU1\", \"IPCEF1\", \"ANKRD22\", \"TREM2\", \"CTSB\", \"SKAP2\", \"IL4R\", \"MS4A4E\", \"ITGAM\", \"EGR3\", \"P2RY12\", \"SAT1\", \"FMNL1\", \"PPARG\", \"MAML3\", \"FRMD4A\", \"RIN3\", \"RGS10\", \"ALOX5AP\", \"SPI1\", \"BIN2\", \"XACT\", \"FGD4\", \"MERTK\", \"FCGR3A\", \"ST6GALNAC3\", \"MIR646HG\", \"HLA-DMB\", \"HLA-DQB1\", \"MRC1\", \"PRKCH\", \"ADGRE2\", \"LILRB1\", \"IER3\", \"EMB\", \"HLA-DRB5\", \"ITGB2\", \"LINC02712\", \"PADI2\", \"ETS2\", \"FCGR1B\", \"SIGLEC8\", \"MAN1A1\", \"AL357522.1\", \"CD163L1\", \"SMAP2\", \"THEMIS2\", \"TMIGD3\", \"CD69\", \"AL163541.1\", \"SIGLEC10\", \"CPM\", \"AC120193.1\", \"TRIM38\", \"RNF144B\", \"EPB41L3\", \"FAM149A\", \"MAP3K8\", \"RUNX1\", \"PRKCB\", \"ADORA3\", \"LPAR5\", \"IFNLR1\"\n  ],\n  \"programs\": [\n    {\n      \"program_name\": \"Fc Receptor Signaling and Antibody-Dependent Responses\",\n      \"description\": \"This program encompasses Fc receptors (FCGR1A, FCGR1B, FCGR2A, FCGR3A) and their intracellular signaling machinery including SYK, LYN, HCK, and adaptor proteins FYB1, CARD11, enabling myeloid cells to recognize and respond to antibody-opsonized targets through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.

Targeting lipid mediator synthesis through 5-lipoxygenase or COX-2 inhibition might reduce immunosuppression while maintaining myeloid cell recruitment, thereby enhancing anti-tumor immunity.\",\n      \"significance_score\": 0.68,\n      \"citations\": [\n        {\n          \"source_id\": \"54\",\n          \"notes\": \"ALOX5 in leukotriene synthesis\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"source_id\": \"56\",\n          \"notes\": \"COX-2 and arachidonic acid metabolism in disease\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"supporting_genes\": [\n        \"ALOX5\", \"ALOX5AP\", \"PTGS2\", \"TBXAS1\", \"ACSL1\", \"LPCAT2\"\n      ],\n      \"required_genes_not_in_input\": {\n        \"genes\": [\n          \"LTA4H\", \"PGE2 synthases\", \"15-LOX\", \"COX-1 (PTGS1)\"\n        ],\n        \"citations\": [\n          {\n            \"source_id\": \"56\",\n            \"notes\": \"Additional enzymes in eicosanoid synthesis\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"program_name\": \"Rho GTPase Signaling and Actin Cytoskeletal Dynamics\",\n      \"description\": \"This program encompasses regulators of Rho family small GTPases (VAV1, RAC1) and their guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins (DOCK2, DOCK4, DOCK8, ARHGAP15, ARHGAP25), along with downstream actin polymerization regulators (FMN1).
