The gene list comprises multiple interconnected functional programs that collectively encode immune surveillance capacity, cellular activation and differentiation, and effector functions relevant to anti-tumor immune responses. Through systematic literature review, we identified ten major gene programs spanning T cell receptor signaling, cytotoxic granule secretion, lymphocyte trafficking and adhesion, immune checkpoint regulation, transcriptional control of lymphocyte fate, and signaling pathway components. The significance of these programs lies in their potential role in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment of astrocytomas, where immune cell infiltration and composition have emerged as critical determinants of prognosis and therapeutic response. High-grade gliomas including astrocytomas are characterized by complex immune landscapes with variable infiltration of CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, NK cells, and B cells, and dysregulation of the genes in this panel may influence both primary immune escape and acquired resistance to immunotherapy. Our integrated analysis reveals that the input gene list represents a remarkably coordinated set of immune cell programs centered on lymphocyte activation, migration into the tumor microenvironment, and execution of cytotoxic functions critical for tumor surveillance.\n\n---\n\n## Astrocytoma and the Tumor Immune Microenvironment\n\nAstrocytomas represent a spectrum of central nervous system malignancies arising from astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the brain. Grading ranges from low-grade diffuse astrocytomas (WHO grade 2) to high-grade glioblastomas (WHO grade 4), with prognostic and therapeutic implications varying dramatically across this spectrum[2][3]. The prognosis and treatment response in astrocytomas are substantially influenced by the immune landscape of the tumor microenvironment, which includes resident microglia, infiltrating macrophages, dendritic cells, and adaptive immune cells including T lymphocytes, NK cells, and B lymphocytes[3][6][21]. Unlike many peripheral tumors, the brain has historically been considered an immune-privileged site due to the blood-brain barrier and limited lymphatic drainage. However, recent evidence demonstrates that brain tumors including astrocytomas can mount significant immune responses, and the composition and function of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) directly influence clinical outcomes[2][3].\n\nThe tumor immune microenvironment of astrocytomas is notably heterogeneous across individual cases, with some tumors displaying robust immune infiltration while others show remarkably sparse immune cell populations[3][21]. This variability reflects both intrinsic tumor properties such as mutational burden and immune evasion mechanisms, as well as host factors influencing immune priming and trafficking[21]. Recent studies utilizing single-cell transcriptomics and spatial analysis have revealed that glioma-associated immune cells can be functionally classified into distinct populations with activated, exhausted, or regulatory phenotypes[2][3]. The presence of CD8+ T cells with high expression of cytotoxic genes such as granzyme B and perforin is associated with improved prognosis, whereas increased regulatory T cell infiltration correlates with worse outcomes[2][15]. Understanding the genetic basis of immune cell recruitment, activation, and effector function in the astrocytoma microenvironment is therefore essential for predicting treatment response and identifying novel therapeutic targets.\n\n---\n\n## T Cell Receptor Signaling Complex and Lymphocyte Activation\n\n### Core TCR Signal Transduction Components\n\nThe T cell receptor (TCR) represents the fundamental recognition apparatus through which CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells recognize tumor-associated peptides in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules[8][11][45]. The input gene list includes the complete coding sequence for the TCR signaling complex and its immediate downstream effectors, making this an exceptionally well-represented pathway. The TCR itself is composed of the antigen recognition unit (αβ or γδ heterodimer) physically associated with the CD3 signaling complex and the zeta chain dimer encoded by genes including TRAC, TRBC1, TRBC2, CD3D, CD3E, CD3G, and CD247[8][11]. These genes are essential for TCR assembly and trafficking to the cell surface, where they enable recognition of cognate peptide-MHC complexes presented by dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells within lymph nodes draining astrocytomas.\n\nUpon TCR engagement by cognate antigen, rapid phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) within the CD3 complex recruits the Src family kinase LCK and the Syk family kinase ZAP70, which become activated through trans-phosphorylation[9][42][45]. Both LCK and ZAP70 are present in the input gene list and represent critical obligate components of TCR signal initiation. LCK functions as a proximal kinase that phosphorylates the ITAM tyrosines, while ZAP70 acts as an adaptor kinase that nucleates a signaling complex including LAT (linker for activation of T cells), GRB2, and other proteins that propagate signals downstream toward phospholipase C-gamma, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. The presence of genes encoding these core signal transduction components in the input list indicates that the tissue or cell population from which this gene list was derived contains cells with intact TCR signaling machinery, consistent with the recruitment and infiltration of functionally competent T lymphocytes into astrocytoma specimens.\n\n### Downstream Effector Pathways and Signal Integration\n\nThe downstream signaling network activated following TCR engagement involves multiple pathways that converge on calcium mobilization, transcription factor activation, and cellular proliferation. The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is prominently represented in the input gene list through PIK3CG (encoding the Class IB PI3K p110γ), PIK3CD (encoding Class IA p110δ), PIK3AP1, and PIK3R5, which encode regulatory and catalytic subunits involved in both T cell activation and differentiation[38][40]. These kinases generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate at the plasma membrane, recruiting pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins including AKT and PDK1 to promote cellular survival and proliferation. Notably, INPP5D encodes a phosphatidylinositol phosphatase that negatively regulates this pathway, providing a brake on PI3K signaling that may prevent excessive T cell activation in the tumor microenvironment[54].\n\nThe nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway is activated downstream of TCR signaling through a signaling module including the adaptor proteins CARD11 and BCL10, which organize a signalosome that activates the inhibitor of κB kinase complex[41][44]. Both CARD11 and BCL10 are present in the input gene list, indicating robust capacity for NF-κB-dependent transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and survival factors in the infiltrating lymphocytes. Protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms including PRKCB and PRKCQ are also included in the input list and represent crucial intermediate kinases in TCR signaling that activate both NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. The presence of these multiple signaling components suggests that T cells infiltrating astrocytomas can execute the complete cascade of TCR-initiated signals required for productive immune responses.\n\n---\n\n## Lymphocyte Trafficking, Adhesion, and Extravasation\n\n### Integrin-Mediated Adhesion and Cell-Cell Interactions\n\nThe capacity of lymphocytes to migrate from lymph nodes and peripheral blood into the astrocytoma microenvironment depends critically on expression of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors that facilitate trafficking across the blood-brain barrier and extravasation into the tumor parenchyma. The input gene list includes ITGA4 (encoding integrin alpha-4) and ITGAL (encoding integrin alpha-L), which form heterodimeric complexes with beta-1 and beta-2 chains respectively[1][10]. ITGA4/beta-1 integrin (also called VLA-4) mediates binding to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expressed on brain endothelial cells and tumor-associated fibroblasts, while ITGAL/beta-2 integrin (LFA-1) binds intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and ICAM-2 on similar target cells. Recent spatial transcriptomics studies have demonstrated that plasma cell retention in non-tumor tissue depends on VLA-4 and LFA-1 interactions with stromal components[7], and this mechanism is highly likely to operate in the astrocytoma microenvironment where fibroblasts and endothelial cells express abundant ligands for these integrins.\n\nThe input gene list also includes CD2, which encodes a surface glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily that binds CD58 on antigen-presenting cells and facilitates co-stimulatory signaling[8]. CD2 expression on T cells infiltrating astrocytomas enables both adhesion to and bidirectional signaling with dendritic cells in the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, CD6 and CD48 are included in the input list and represent members of the SLAM (signaling lymphocytic activation molecule) family of receptors that mediate lymphocyte-lymphocyte and lymphocyte-dendritic cell interactions. The presence of multiple redundant adhesion systems in the input gene list reflects the critical importance of efficient immune cell trafficking into brain tumors, where the blood-brain barrier presents a significant physical barrier to infiltration.\n\n### Chemokine Receptor Signaling\n\nThe input gene list includes CXCR4, which encodes a seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled chemokine receptor that binds CXCL12 and plays multiple roles in lymphocyte trafficking, activation, and survival[21]. CXCR4 expression is particularly important for recruitment of lymphocytes into secondary lymphoid organs and specialized microenvironmental niches. In the context of astrocytoma, CXCR4 may mediate both trafficking of lymphocytes toward chemokine gradients emanating from the tumor and retention of lymphocytes within specialized niches in the tumor microenvironment. Notably, regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins including RGS1 are present in the input list, providing negative feedback on G protein-coupled receptor signaling downstream of chemokine receptors and thereby modulating the intensity and duration of chemotactic signals.\n\n---\n\n## Cytotoxic Lymphocyte Effector Functions\n\n### Granule-Mediated Cytotoxicity\n\nThe execution of target cell killing by CD8+ T cells and NK cells depends critically on the secretion of cytotoxic granules containing serine proteases and pore-forming proteins. The input gene list includes an exceptionally rich representation of genes encoding components of the cytotoxic granule system, including GZMA, GZMB, GZMK, GZMH, PRF1, GNLY, and CTSW[13][14][16][17][66]. Granzymes are serine proteases that, after delivery into target cells via perforin-mediated pores, activate caspase-independent pathways of programmed cell death by cleaving substrates in the endoplasmic reticulum and other compartments. Granzyme B is the most abundant and immunologically well-characterized serine protease and is strongly associated with CD8+ T cell terminal differentiation and effector function[15][51][66].\n\nPerforin (PRF1) encodes a pore-forming protein homologous to complement component C9 that oligomerizes in target cell membranes to create channels through which granzymes enter the cytoplasm[14][17]. The presence of perforin in the input gene list alongside multiple granzymes indicates that lymphocytes infiltrating astrocytomas have acquired or maintained the capacity for rapid, contact-dependent killing of tumor cells. The cathepsin protease CTSW (cathepsin W) is also present and represents an additional serine protease distinct from but complementary to the granzymes in its ability to induce target cell death[51].\n\n### Natural Killer Cell-Type Cytotoxicity\n\nBeyond T cell-intrinsic cytotoxic mechanisms, the input gene list contains markers and effector molecules characteristic of NK cell function. NK cells represent innate lymphocytes that recognize and eliminate aberrant cells including tumor cells through both perforin-granzyme-mediated killing and death receptor-ligand interactions[19][22][25]. The input gene list includes natural killer group 2D (NKG7), a gene that encodes a component of the NKG2D receptor complex expressed on both NK cells and CD8+ T cells[13][19]. NKG2D binds MHC class I-related chain molecules (MICA and MICB) that are frequently upregulated on transformed cells including glioma cells, making NKG2D-mediated recognition a potential mechanism for immune surveillance of astrocytomas.\n\nThe input gene list also includes KLRK1 (encoding NKG2D), KLRD1 (encoding NKG2D ligand CD94), KLRC1 (encoding NKG2A), KLRC2 (encoding NKG2C), and KLRC4 (encoding NKG2E), which collectively represent the major natural killer receptors involved in both activation and inhibition of NK cell cytotoxic function[22][25][56]. These receptors are members of the killer cell lectin-like receptor family and mediate recognition of MHC class I and MHC class I-like molecules on target cells[22]. The balance between activation signals from receptors like NKG2D and inhibitory signals from receptors like NKG2A (which binds HLA-E) determines whether NK cells mount an effective anti-tumor response or remain quiescent.\n\n---\n\n## Immune Checkpoint Regulation and T Cell Exhaustion\n\n### PD-1 and T Cell Fate in Persistent Antigen Stimulation\n\nPDCD1, which encodes the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), is present in the input gene list and represents one of the most critical inhibitory receptors regulating T cell function in chronic antigen exposure and tumor microenvironments[30][32]. PD-1 is an inducible receptor upregulated on recently activated T cells, particularly those undergoing continued antigen-specific proliferation in response to cognate peptide-MHC complexes. Recent high-resolution spatial and functional studies have revealed a nuanced role for PD-1 in maintaining stem-like progenitor CD8+ T cells during active antigen presentation in tumor-draining lymph nodes[30]. Critically, PD-1 does not uniformly induce T cell exhaustion; rather, PD-1-PD-L1 interactions in the context of late antigen presentation niches appear to maintain the proliferative potential and self-renewal capacity of stem-like T cell progenitors by attenuating strong TCR signaling that would otherwise drive terminal differentiation[15][30].\n\nThe implications of this mechanism for astrocytoma immunotherapy are substantial. Many glioblastomas express PD-L1 at low to moderate levels, and checkpoint blockade with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies has shown promise in early clinical trials[21][30]. However, the finding that PD-1 signaling maintains stem-like T cell populations with proliferative potential suggests that PD-1 blockade could precipitate terminal differentiation or even apoptosis of the most functionally important tumor-specific T cells. This may explain clinical observations that checkpoint blockade benefits only a subset of glioma patients and that acquired resistance emerges rapidly in some cases[21][30].\n\n### Co-Stimulatory and Co-Inhibitory Molecules\n\nBeyond PD-1, the input gene list includes ICOS (inducible T cell costimulator), which encodes a member of the CD28 family of co-stimulatory receptors[48][50]. ICOS is preferentially expressed on activated T helper cells and certain populations of CD8+ T cells and delivers potent co-stimulatory signals upon engagement by its ligand ICOSL on dendritic cells and B cells. The presence of ICOS in the input gene list indicates that T cells infiltrating astrocytomas retain the capacity for receiving positive co-stimulatory signals that can enhance proliferation and cytokine production. Conversely, PTGDR (which encodes the prostaglandin D receptor DP4) is also present and represents an inhibitory receptor that can suppress T cell activation and is upregulated in exhausted T cell populations.\n\n---\n\n## Transcriptional Control of Lymphocyte Differentiation and Function\n\n### Master Regulatory Transcription Factors\n\nThe input gene list includes multiple transcription factors that orchestrate lymphocyte differentiation and function, including RUNX3, BATF, ETS1, IKZF1, and IKZF3[25][27][28][29][56]. RUNX3 encodes a member of the runt-related transcription factor family that is critically important for CD8+ T cell lineage specification and terminal differentiation[27]. RUNX3 drives expression of cytotoxic effector molecules including granzyme B and perforin while simultaneously repressing CD4 lineage-specifying genes, thereby establishing and maintaining CD8+ T cell identity[27].\n\nBATF (basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor) encodes an AP-1 family member that functions as a pioneer transcription factor in CD8+ T cells, opening chromatin at enhancers of genes encoding activation markers, transcription factors, and effector molecules during T cell differentiation[2][15][30]. BATF is highly expressed in activated CD8+ T cells infiltrating tumors and is considered a marker of T cell activation and terminal differentiation[15][30]. The presence of BATF in the input gene list alongside CD8+ T cell markers and cytotoxic effector genes indicates that the tissue source of this gene list contains cells with activated CD8+ T cell transcriptional programs.\n\nETS1 (ETS proto-oncogene 1 transcription factor) is included in the input list and encodes a member of the Ets family of transcription factors that regulates developmental and functional programs in both T cells and NK cells[56]. ETS1 is particularly important in NK cell terminal differentiation and the acquisition of cytotoxic potential[56]. IKZF1 and IKZF3 encode members of the Ikaros family of zinc finger transcription factors that regulate lymphocyte development, proliferation, and differentiation[26][29]. IKZF1 is essential for early T cell development in the thymus, while IKZF3 (Aiolos) functions in B cell development and has recently been identified as a key regulator of memory T cell formation and survival[25][26][29].\n\n### PRDM1 and Lymphocyte Terminal Differentiation\n\nWhile not explicitly included in the input gene list, PRDM1 represents a critical transcription factor for plasma cell differentiation and CD8+ T cell terminal differentiation that interacts functionally with genes in the input list[25]. PRDM1 encodes a transcriptional repressor that acts to silence genes associated with proliferation and lymphocyte trafficking while upregulating genes encoding survival factors and effector molecules[25]. The presence in the input list of genes that PRDM1 targets (such as genes encoding granzymes and perforin) indicates that the infiltrating lymphocytes have undergone significant differentiation toward terminal effector states.\n\n---\n\n## Immune Synapse Formation and Cell-Cell Communication\n\n### SLAM Family Receptors and Lymphocyte Cooperation\n\nThe input gene list includes multiple members of the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family of immunoreceptors, including SLAMF1, SLAMF6, SLAMF7, and CD48[7][15][19][31]. These receptors function as homophilic adhesion molecules that bring lymphocytes into intimate contact and simultaneously deliver co-stimulatory or inhibitory signals depending on the partner molecules engaged. SLAMF6 is particularly important in the current context, as it has been identified as a marker of stem-like, self-renewing progenitor CD8+ T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes[15][30]. SLAMF6+ stem-like CD8+ T cells maintain high expression of TCF-1 and other markers of stemness while undergoing active TCR signaling, and critically, these cells preferentially expand following checkpoint blockade therapy[15][30].\n\nThe presence of SLAMF6 in the input gene list suggests that the tissue or cell population from which the genes were derived contains cells with stem-like progenitor potential, which is a critical determinant of response to checkpoint immunotherapy. In the context of astrocytoma, maintenance of SLAMF6+ stem-like T cell populations within tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes may predict enhanced responses to PD-1 blockade and other immunotherapies. CD244 (2B4), another receptor included in the input list, mediates NK cell co-stimulation through interaction with CD48 on target cells and facilitates the killing of tumor cells by mature NK cells[31][51].\n\n---\n\n## B Cell and Humoral Immunity Components\n\n### B Cell Recruitment and Antibody Responses\n\nRecent evidence has revealed that tumor-infiltrating B lymphocytes (TIL-Bs) play underappreciated roles in anti-tumor immunity distinct from but complementary to T cell responses[5][7][57]. The input gene list does not contain classic B cell-specific markers such as CD19 or CD20, but does include genes associated with B-T cell cooperation such as ICOS (which is preferentially expressed on T follicular helper cells and signals through ICOSL on B cells) and CD48 (which engages B cell receptors on B cells). Additionally, genes encoding ligands for B cell receptors and other B cell-activating signals are abundant in the input list, suggesting an environment permissive for B cell activation and survival.\n\nA recent study demonstrating that CSDE1 knockout enhances tumor-infiltrating B cell levels and improves anti-tumor immunity provides important context for interpreting the significance of B cell-promoting genes in this list[5][57]. The study showed that depletion of B cells reversed the anti-tumor effects of CSDE1 deletion, demonstrating that B cells themselves—not merely their antibody products—mediate critical anti-tumor functions. The enriched representation of lymphocyte adhesion and trafficking genes in the input list, including integrins and chemokine receptors, would be expected to support B cell trafficking into tumors in a manner analogous to T cell recruitment.\n\n---\n\n## Signal Transduction and Second Messenger Pathways\n\n### Phosphatidylinositol and Calcium Signaling\n\nBeyond the PI3K components already discussed, the input gene list includes genes encoding additional phospholipid signaling molecules critical for lymphocyte activation. Phospholipase C-gamma (not in the input list but downstream of TCR) generates inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol upon TCR stimulation. INPP5D, which is present in the input list, encodes a phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphatase (also called SHIP-1) that dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate, thereby terminating PI3K signaling[54]. This negative feedback mechanism is critical for preventing excessive lymphocyte activation and maintaining appropriate immune homeostasis.\n\nThe input gene list includes ATP2A3, which encodes the SPCA1 (secretory pathway calcium ATPase) that maintains calcium stores in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Lymphocyte activation triggers sustained calcium influx into the cytoplasm through CRAC channels, and ATP2A3 is essential for refilling intracellular calcium stores to maintain the prolonged calcium signaling required for transcription factor activation and effector function[21][37]. The presence of this calcium homeostasis gene in the input list indicates that the infiltrating lymphocytes have sustained capacity for the calcium-dependent signaling required for anti-tumor responses.\n\n### RhoGTPase Regulation and Cytoskeletal Dynamics\n\nMultiple genes encoding components of the Rho family of small GTPases and their regulators are present in the input list, including RAC2, RHOH, ARHGAP15, ARHGAP25, ARHGAP30, and others. RAC GTPases regulate actin polymerization at the immunological synapse, controlling the formation of the dense actin scaffold required for efficient TCR signaling and granule polarization during cytotoxic lymphocyte-mediated killing[34][37]. RHOH plays specialized roles in TCR signaling by regulating LAT complex assembly and NF-κB activation[55]. The ARHGAP proteins encode GTPase-activating proteins that terminate RAC and RHO signaling, providing negative feedback on actin dynamics and immune synapse stability.\n\n---\n\n## Cytokine Production and Immune Signaling\n\n### Interleukin Receptor Complexes\n\nThe input gene list includes genes encoding components of interleukin receptor complexes, particularly IL2RB and IL2RG, which encode the beta and gamma chains of the IL-2 receptor[20][46]. IL-2 is a critical cytokine produced by activated T cells that acts in an autocrine and paracrine manner to promote T cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The presence of IL2RG (encoding the common gamma chain also used by IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 receptors) is particularly significant, as signaling through these receptors is essential for lymphocyte development, expansion, and sustained survival in response to antigen stimulation[20][25][46].\n\nIL7R, which encodes the IL-7 receptor alpha chain, is also present and represents a receptor critical for maintenance of naive T cell pools and long-lived memory T cells[20]. IL-7 is produced by stromal cells and endothelial cells in secondary lymphoid organs and non-lymphoid tissues and is one of the most important homeostatic cytokines controlling T cell survival. In the context of astrocytoma, IL-7 signaling may be particularly important for maintaining long-lived tumor-specific memory T cells that can provide sustained anti-tumor immunity.\n\nIL18R1, which encodes one component of the IL-18 receptor, is also present[46]. IL-18 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that acts together with IL-12 to promote IFN-γ production by T cells and NK cells. The presence of IL18R1 in the input list indicates that infiltrating lymphocytes retain the capacity to respond to IL-18 signaling, which is abundant in inflammatory microenvironments including brain tumors.\n\n### Interferon Signaling\n\nThe input gene list includes IFNG-AS1, a long non-coding RNA that is transcribed from the locus antisense to IFNG (encoding interferon-gamma)[43]. While the functional significance of IFNG-AS1 remains to be fully elucidated, its presence suggests that the tissue source of the input gene list contains cells with active interferon-gamma signaling. IFN-γ is a critical Th1 and CD8+ T cell-derived cytokine that activates macrophages, enhances antigen presentation, and directly inhibits tumor cell proliferation[21][33][43].\n\n---\n\n## Role of Astrocytoma-Associated Alterations in Lymphocyte Function\n\n### Neuron-Lymphocyte Interactions in the Peritumoral Cortex\n\nRecent evidence indicates that tumor-associated seizures in patients with cortical gliomas including astrocytomas result from direct neuron-tumor cell interactions mediated by synaptic molecules[6]. Neurons in the peritumoral cortex form excitatory synapses with glioma cells that enhance glioma proliferation and progression[6]. These tumor-neuron interactions occur in the physical and functional context of immune cells infiltrating the peritumoral region. The genes in the input list encoding adhesion molecules, chemokine receptors, and synaptic proteins may facilitate both lymphocyte-neuron interactions and lymphocyte-glioma interactions within the peritumoral microenvironment. For instance, CD2 and other adhesion molecules could mediate lymphocyte adhesion to neurons expressing CD58, potentially enabling anti-inflammatory signaling that could mitigate neuron-glioma crosstalk-driven progression.\n\n### Immune Infiltration Patterns in Pediatric High-Grade Gliomas\n\nRecent comprehensive characterization of mouse models of pediatric high-grade gliomas revealed that the specific oncogenic driver (BRAF, EGFR/FGFR, PDGFRA, or others) fundamentally shapes the immune cell infiltration pattern in developing brain tumors[39]. Notably, different glioma subtypes showed distinct immune compositions, with some driven tumors displaying low B and T cell infiltration but variable macrophage abundance[39]. The genes in the input list would be expected to regulate immune cell recruitment differentially depending on the tumor type and immune microenvironment. In tumors with sparse immune infiltration, upregulation of genes encoding chemokine receptors (such as CXCR4) and adhesion molecules might enhance immune recruitment, whereas in tumors with robust immune infiltration, upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules like PDCD1 might limit excessive immune-mediated damage to the brain parenchyma.\n\n---\n\n## Integration: The Immune Gene Program in Astrocytoma Context\n\nCollectively, the 144 genes in the input list form an integrated system supporting immune cell development, trafficking, activation, and effector function within the astrocytoma microenvironment. The presence of nearly complete molecular machinery for TCR signaling, cytotoxic granule secretion, lymphocyte adhesion, and transcriptional control of lymphocyte differentiation indicates that the tissue source was enriched for lymphocytes that had recently undergone or were actively undergoing antigen-specific activation. In the context of astrocytoma, this gene enrichment pattern suggests that the tumor microenvironment supported infiltration, activation, and ongoing stimulation of tumor-specific lymphocytes. The genes encoding checkpoint molecules like PDCD1 suggest that prolonged antigen exposure and chronic stimulation had led to upregulation of inhibitory receptors that limit T cell proliferation and cytokine production, potentially contributing to immune dysfunction observed in many patients with advanced gliomas.\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Gene Program Analysis\n\nBased on comprehensive literature review and functional integration of pathway information, we identified ten major gene programs:\n\n### Program 1: T Cell Receptor Signal Transduction\n\n**Description**: This program encompasses the complete molecular machinery for TCR recognition of cognate peptide-MHC complexes and initiation of downstream signaling cascades. The TCR complex itself (CD3D, CD3E, CD3G, CD247) directly recognizes antigen, while the Src family kinase LCK and the Syk family kinase ZAP70 rapidly phosphorylate ITAM motifs to recruit and activate downstream effectors. Signaling integrates through multiple pathways including the MAPK/ERK cascade, PI3K/AKT pathway, and NF-κB pathway, with signal termination mediated by phosphatases like PTPN22. In astrocytoma, TCR signaling intensity and duration determine T cell differentiation fate, with weak or attenuated signals promoting memory formation while strong sustained signals drive terminal effector differentiation.\n\n**Supporting genes**: CD247, CD3D, CD3E, CD3G, TRAC, TRBC1, TRBC2, LCK, ZAP70, PTPN22, PTPN7, PTPN6, PIK3CG, PIK3CD, INPP5D, CARD11, BCL10, PRKCB, PRKCQ, IKZF1, IKZF3\n\n**Predicted cellular impact**: \n- Enhanced T cell recognition of tumor antigens presented on MHC\n- Sustained proliferation and differentiation of tumor-specific T cell clones\n- Integration of co-stimulatory and inhibitory signals determining T cell fate\n- Generation of long-lived tumor-specific memory and effector populations\n\n**Evidence summary**: The complete TCR signaling cascade is well-established to be essential for T cell activation and has been extensively characterized in both physiological and tumor microenvironments[15][30][45]. Recent studies identify LCK and ZAP70 as critical early events in TCR signaling, and the presence of phosphatases like PTPN22 enables tuning of signal intensity[45]. In tumor microenvironments, integration of TCR signals with co-stimulatory signals and checkpoint molecules determines whether T cells mount productive responses or undergo exhaustion[21][30].\n\n**Significance score**: 0.92\n\n**Citations**: [8][11][30][45][62][63]\n\n---\n\n### Program 2: Lymphocyte Trafficking and Extravasation\n\n**Description**: This program encompasses adhesion molecules, chemokine receptors, and accessory proteins that enable lymphocytes to exit secondary lymphoid organs, migrate through the blood, cross the blood-brain barrier, and infiltrate the astrocytoma parenchyma. Integrins including α4β1 (VLA-4) and αLβ2 (LFA-1) mediate initial rolling and firm adhesion to endothelial cells expressing VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 respectively. Chemokine receptors including CXCR4 respond to chemokine gradients produced by tumor cells and stromal cells, directing lymphocyte migration into the tumor. This program is essential for transforming systemic anti-tumor immunity into local anti-tumor responses within the brain tumor microenvironment.\n\n**Supporting genes**: ITGA4, ITGAL, ITGA1, CD2, CD48, CD6, CXCR4, RGS1, LSP1, GIMAP5, GIMAP7\n\n**Predicted cellular impact**:\n- Efficient recruitment of tumor-specific T cells and NK cells into astrocytomas across the blood-brain barrier\n- Positioning of immune cells in close proximity to tumor cells for surveillance and effector functions\n- Formation of immunological synapses between lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells in the tumor microenvironment\n- Adaptation of lymphocyte trafficking to tumor-induced changes in chemokine and adhesion molecule expression\n\n**Evidence summary**: Integrins are well-established as essential mediators of lymphocyte trafficking into peripheral and central nervous system tissues[7][10]. VLA-4 and LFA-1 are redundantly required for efficient T cell infiltration into brain tissues under inflammatory conditions[10][49]. CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12 are critical for both recruitment and retention of lymphocytes in specialized tissue microenvironments[7]. LSP1 has been demonstrated to regulate PECAM-1 expression on endothelial cells and facilitate lymphocyte transendothelial migration[47][49].\n\n**Significance score**: 0.88\n\n**Citations**: [1][7][10][47][49]\n\n---\n\n### Program 3: Cytotoxic Granule-Mediated Killing\n\n**Description**: This program encodes the machinery for perforin-granzyme-mediated killing of tumor cells by CD8+ T cells and NK cells. Granules containing serine proteases (granzymes A, B, K, H), the pore-forming protein perforin, and cytotoxic lymphocyte-specific granule proteins are secreted onto target cell membranes following immune synapse formation. Perforin creates channels allowing granzyme entry, and intracellular granzymes cleave multiple substrates inducing caspase-independent apoptosis. This represents the primary mechanism by which infiltrating CD8+ T cells and NK cells directly eliminate glioma cells in the tumor microenvironment.\n\n**Supporting genes**: GZMA, GZMB, GZMK, GZMH, PRF1, GNLY, CTSW, NKG7\n\n**Predicted cellular impact**:\n- Direct cytotoxic killing of tumor cells engaging with immune cells at the astrocytoma-immune interface\n- Elimination of individual glioma cells that have evaded other immune mechanisms\n- Generation of tumor cell death signals that can activate inflammatory cascades and antigen presentation\n- Control of tumor growth rate through continuous cytotoxic assault on malignant cells\n\n**Evidence summary**: Perforin and granzymes are the primary effector molecules of cytotoxic T cell and NK cell killing[13][14][16][17][51][66]. Granzyme B is particularly abundant and strongly associated with CD8+ T cell effector function, while granzyme K and other granzymes provide redundancy and substrate specialization[13][16]. Perforin is absolutely required for efficient in vivo killing, and mutations in perforin cause familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis characterized by immunodeficiency[14]. In tumors, the presence of high perforin and granzyme expression is associated with improved outcomes, particularly in high-grade gliomas[2][15].\n\n**Significance score**: 0.95\n\n**Citations**: [13][14][16][17][51][66]\n\n---\n\n### Program 4: Natural Killer Cell Activation and Function\n\n**Description**: This program encompasses NK cell-specific receptors, adaptors, and effector molecules that enable NK cells to recognize and kill transformed cells through both activating receptor-ligand interactions and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) recognizes MHC class I-related chain molecules (MICA/MICB) upregulated on transformed cells. Inhibitory receptors including NKG2A (binding HLA-E) and other killer immunoglobulin-like receptors provide \"missing self\" recognition, allowing NK cells to spare healthy cells expressing normal MHC class I. The balance between activation and inhibition determines whether NK cells mount productive anti-tumor responses or remain quiescent in the tumor microenvironment.\n\n**Supporting genes**: KLRK1, KLRD1, KLRC1, KLRC2, KLRC4, NKG7, NCR1, HCST\n\n**Predicted cellular impact**:\n- Recognition of MHC-abnormal and MICA/MICB-expressing glioma cells by NK cells\n- Elimination of glioma cells that have downregulated MHC class I as an immune evasion mechanism\n- Regulation of NK cell activation by tumor cell-derived ligands and stromal signals\n- Contribution to innate anti-tumor immunity preceding adaptive immune responses\n\n**Evidence summary**: NKG2D is a major activating receptor for both NK cells and CD8+ T cells, recognizing stress-inducible ligands MICA and MICB that are frequently upregulated on tumors[22][25][56]. Inhibitory NK receptors including NKG2A bind MHC-E and other MHC-related molecules, providing negative regulation that prevents NK cell activation against healthy cells[22]. NK cells with high expression of activating receptors and low expression of inhibitory receptors show enhanced anti-tumor activity[19][25][31]. In gliomas, NK cell infiltration is variable and correlates with immune response potential[2][3][39].\n\n**Significance score**: 0.87\n\n**Citations**: [22][25][31][56]\n\n---\n\n### Program 5: Immune Checkpoint Regulation and T Cell Stemness\n\n**Description**: This program encompasses checkpoint molecules (PD-1, CTLA-4, TIGIT, and others) and co-stimulatory molecules (ICOS, CD28) that regulate T cell activation state and differentiation trajectory. Recent evidence reveals that PD-1, rather than universally driving exhaustion, maintains stem-like progenitor CD8+ T cells during active antigen presentation by attenuating strong TCR signaling that would otherwise drive terminal differentiation. High-PD-1 CD8+ T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes retain TCF-1 expression, self-renewal capacity, and proliferative potential. Checkpoint blockade can drive these cells toward terminal differentiation or apoptosis, explaining both the efficacy and the limitations of checkpoint immunotherapy in astrocytomas.\n\n**Supporting genes**: PDCD1, ICOS, PTGDR, SLAMF1, SLAMF6, SLAMF7, CD244, CD48\n\n**Predicted cellular impact**:\n- Maintenance of tumor-specific stem-like CD8+ T cell progenitors during tumor antigen exposure\n- Attenuation of TCR signaling intensity to promote stemness over terminal differentiation\n- Integration of co-stimulatory signals promoting T cell survival and proliferation\n- Coordination of T cell fate decisions with checkpoints determining response to immunotherapy\n\n**Evidence summary**: PD-1 engagement by its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 suppresses TCR signaling through recruitment of phosphatases, notably SHP-2[30][32]. Remarkably, recent spatial analysis in tumor-draining lymph nodes revealed that the most PD-1-high stem-like CD8+ T cells are enriched in late antigen presentation niches with high TCR affinity and active antigen encounter[15][30]. PD-1 blockade drives these cells toward terminal differentiation with increased granzyme expression but decreased stemness markers[30]. In astrocytoma patients, checkpoint blockade efficacy correlates with maintenance of stem-like T cell populations prior to treatment[15][21][30].\n\n**Significance score**: 0.89\n\n**Citations**: [15][21][30][32]\n\n---\n\n### Program 6: Transcriptional Control of Lymphocyte Differentiation\n\n**Description**: This program comprises transcription factors that determine lymphocyte lineage identity, differentiation state, and effector function. RUNX3 is a master regulator of CD8+ T cell identity, driving expression of cytotoxic molecules while repressing CD4 genes. BATF functions as a pioneer factor opening chromatin at activation-associated enhancers during T cell differentiation. ETS1 regulates NK cell terminal differentiation and effector function. IKZF1 and IKZF3 control lymphocyte development and memory formation. Together, these transcription factors orchestrate the transcriptional programs that transform naive lymphocytes into activated effectors capable of eliminating tumor cells.\n\n**Supporting genes**: RUNX3, BATF, ETS1, IKZF1, IKZF3\n\n**Predicted cellular impact**:\n- Establishment and maintenance of CD8+ T cell identity in the face of tumor microenvironment-induced plasticity\n- Rapid upregulation of cytotoxic effector genes (granzymes, perforin) upon tumor antigen encounter\n- Opening of chromatin at activation-associated enhancers enabling rapid transcriptional responses\n- Integration of developmental signals with tumor microenvironment cues\n\n**Evidence summary**: RUNX3 is absolutely required for CD8+ T cell development and function, with RUNX3-deficient mice showing a complete loss of mature CD8+ T cells[27]. BATF functions as a pioneer transcription factor, binding to closed chromatin regions and recruiting histone acetylases to establish active chromatin landscapes[15][30]. ETS1 is essential for NK cell development, with conditional knockout resulting in severe NK cell deficiencies[56]. IKZF1 loss impairs T cell development, while IKZF3 is important for memory T cell formation[25][26][29].\n\n**Significance score**: 0.86\n\n**Citations**: [25][27][28][29][56]\n\n---\n\n### Program 7: Immune Synapse Assembly and Co-signaling\n\n**Description**: This program encompasses SLAM family receptors and other cell-cell adhesion molecules that mediate the formation of immune synapses between T cells and dendritic cells, between T cells and B cells, and between T cells and tumor cells. SLAMF6 marks stem-like CD8+ T progenitors and mediates signaling critical for maintenance of T cell stemness. SLAMF1 and SLAMF7 mediate lymphocyte-dendritic cell and T-B cell cooperation. CD244 mediates NK cell co-stimulation through interaction with CD48. These interactions provide both adhesive forces maintaining cell-cell contact and bi-directional signaling that regulates lymphocyte activation and differentiation.\n\n**Supporting genes**: SLAMF1, SLAMF6, SLAMF7, CD244, CD48, CD2, CD6\n\n**Predicted cellular impact**:\n- Formation of stable immune synapses enabling prolonged antigen recognition and TCR signaling\n- Bi-directional communication between immune cells coordinating anti-tumor responses\n- Maintenance of stem-like T cell progenitors through SLAMF6-mediated signaling\n- Enhancement of NK cell killing through CD244-CD48 co-stimulatory interactions\n\n**Evidence summary**: SLAMF6 has been recently identified as a marker of stem-like CD8+ T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes, with high SLAMF6 expression correlating with TCF-1 expression and proliferative potential[15][30]. SLAMF receptors are described as \"switch receptors\" capable of delivering either activating or inhibitory signals depending on co-receptor engagement[31]. CD244 enhances NK cell killing through co-engagement with activating receptors[31][51]. The SLAM family represents a critical interface for lymphocyte-lymphocyte and lymphocyte-dendritic cell communication[7].\n\n**Significance score**: 0.84\n\n**Citations**: [7][15][30][31][51]\n\n---\n\n### Program 8: Phosphatidylinositol Signaling and Lipid Metabolism\n\n**Description**: This program includes enzymes controlling phosphatidylinositol lipid metabolism, which serves as the molecular platform for both plasma membrane signaling complexes and organellar membrane dynamics. Class I and Class II PI3K isoforms (PIK3CG, PIK3CD) generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate in response to TCR signaling and cytokine receptor engagement. INPP5D (SHIP-1) terminates PI3K signaling through dephosphorylation of this key lipid. These lipid species recruit pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins including AKT and PDK1 to specific membrane regions, enabling kinase activation and downstream signaling. Dysregulation of this pathway is implicated in both lymphocyte dysfunction and lymphoid malignancies.\n\n**Supporting genes**: PIK3CG, PIK3CD, PIK3AP1, PIK3R5, INPP5D\n\n**Predicted cellular impact**:\n- Enhanced PI3K/AKT signaling in response to TCR and cytokine receptor engagement\n- Appropriate termination of PI3K signaling preventing excessive lymphocyte activation\n- Generation of docking sites for signaling proteins including AKT, Btk, and PLC-gamma\n- Control of lymphocyte proliferation, survival, and differentiation through lipid-dependent mechanisms\n\n**Evidence summary**: Class I PI3K generates PIP3 at the plasma membrane and on endosomal membranes, recruiting proteins with pleckstrin homology domains[38][40]. INPP5D (SHIP-1) is essential for immune homeostasis, with SHIP-1-deficient mice showing severe autoimmunity and enhanced immune activation[54]. PI3K signaling is hyperactivated in certain T cell lymphomas, driving lymphomagenesis and promoting resistance to checkpoint blockade. In normal T cells, the balance between PI3K activation and INPP5D-mediated termination determines the magnitude and duration of proliferative signals.\n\n**Significance score**: 0.81\n\n**Citations**: [38][40][54]\n\n---\n\n### Program 9: RhoGTPase Regulation and Actin Dynamics\n\n**Description**: This program includes Rho family GTPases and their regulators (GAPs, GEFs) that control actin polymerization at the immune synapse and during lymphocyte migration. RAC GTPases regulate the assembly of the dense actin scaffold at the interface between lymphocytes and target cells, which is essential for stable immune synapse formation, efficient TCR signaling, and directed granule secretion. RHOH provides RAC-independent mechanisms of TCR signaling regulation. ARHGAP family proteins terminate RAC and RHO signaling through GTPase-activating function, providing negative feedback. The balance between RAC activation and ARHGAP-mediated termination determines immune synapse stability and duration.\n\n**Supporting genes**: RAC2, RHOH, ARHGAP15, ARHGAP25, ARHGAP30, CORO1A, CYTIP\n\n**Predicted cellular impact**:\n- Rapid actin polymerization at immune synapses enabling stable lymphocyte-tumor cell contacts\n- Facilitation of granule polarization and directional secretion of cytotoxic mediators\n- Enhanced lymphocyte migration through brain tissue toward glioma cells\n- Adaptation of actin dynamics to changes in immune synapse formation requirements\n\n**Evidence summary**: RAC GTPases are essential for immune synapse formation and TCR signaling, with RAC-deficient T cells showing severe impairment in TCR-induced calcium flux and IL-2 production[34][37]. RHOH regulates LAT complex assembly independent of RAC, providing redundancy in TCR signaling[55]. The ARHGAP family proteins provide negative feedback on Rho GTPase signaling, with dysregulation implicated in immunodeficiencies and autoimmune diseases[34]. Actin dynamics are particularly important in the central nervous system where lymphocytes must navigate through the dense, structured brain parenchyma[6].\n\n**Significance score**: 0.79\n\n**Citations**: [34][37][55]\n\n---\n\n### Program 10: Cytokine Receptor Signaling and Lymphocyte Survival\n\n**Description**: This program encompasses receptors for interleukins critical for lymphocyte development, expansion, and survival, including IL-2, IL-7, IL-15, IL-18, and others. IL2RB and IL2RG form part of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor that promotes T cell proliferation and activation. IL7R signaling is essential for maintenance of naive T cell pools and memory T cell survival through homeostatic proliferation. IL18R1 enables response to IL-18, a pro-inflammatory cytokine promoting IFN-γ production in T cells and NK cells. Collectively, these signaling pathways provide survival and expansion signals that counterbalance terminal differentiation, enabling long-lived anti-tumor immunity.\n\n**Supporting genes**: IL2RB, IL2RG, IL7R, IL18R1\n\n**Predicted cellular impact**:\n- IL-2-driven clonal expansion of tumor-specific T cells following antigen encounter\n- IL-7-mediated homeostatic survival of long-lived memory T cells in the tumor microenvironment\n- IL-18-driven IFN-γ production amplifying local inflammatory and anti-tumor responses\n- Integration of cytokine signals with TCR signals determining T cell fate (expansion vs. differentiation)\n\n**Evidence summary**: IL-2 is a critical autocrine and paracrine T cell growth factor that promotes both proliferation and terminal differentiation, with the balance determined by co-signals and transcription factor activity[20][25][46]. IL-7 is constitutively produced by stromal cells and is essential for T cell survival through STAT5 activation, with IL-7 deficiency causing severe T cell lymphopenia[20]. IL-18 synergizes with IL-12 to promote Th1 differentiation and IFN-γ production by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells[46]. In tumors, availability of these cytokines influences the sustainability of anti-tumor immune responses and the development of memory immunity[21][25].\n\n**Significance score**: 0.82\n\n**Citations**: [20][25][46]\n\n---\n\n## Integrated Analysis: Gene Programs in the Context of Astrocytoma Immune Escape and Immunotherapy\n\nThe ten gene programs identified above form an integrated system supporting immune surveillance of astrocytomas. However, their expression patterns and functional status are modulated by the unique characteristics of the brain tumor microenvironment. High-grade gliomas including astrocytomas have evolved multiple mechanisms to suppress anti-tumor immunity despite potentially robust infiltration of lymphocytes. First, gliomas often downregulate MHC class I expression or harbor mutations in the beta-2 microglobulin gene that encodes a component of the MHC class I complex[2][21]. This prevents presentation of tumor antigens to CD8+ T cells, thereby impairing TCR recognition despite the presence of functional TCR signaling machinery encoded by genes in Program 1.\n\nSecond, gliomas frequently upregulate ligands for checkpoint molecules, particularly PD-L1, which engage PDCD1 (PD-1) on infiltrating T cells[21][30]. Recent evidence suggests that this interaction does not uniformly induce exhaustion but rather maintains stem-like T cell populations through attenuation of TCR signaling—a double-edged sword where checkpoint blockade can both enhance effector function and drive problematic terminal differentiation of the most functionally important stem-like progenitors[30].\n\nThird, the brain tumor microenvironment is characterized by a dense population of glial cells, meninges, and extracellular matrix that can impede efficient lymphocyte trafficking and immune synapse formation despite the presence of adhesion molecules and trafficking receptors encoded by Program 2 genes[6][21]. Recent evidence suggests that glioma cells themselves actively suppress lymphocyte infiltration through barriers including hypoxia, acidosis, and extracellular matrix deposition[21].\n\nFourth, activation of the immunosuppressive enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in the glioma microenvironment depletes tryptophan and generates immunosuppressive kynurenine metabolites that directly inhibit T cell proliferation and promote regulatory T cell development[21]. While IDO is not directly encoded in the input gene list, its effects are manifested through dysregulation of the cytokine signaling pathways and transcription factor networks represented in Programs 7 and 10.\n\nDespite these challenges, checkpoint blockade with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies has shown promise in early clinical trials for both glioblastoma and lower-grade gliomas[21][30]. The mechanism by which checkpoint blockade overcomes immune suppression appears to involve reversal of PD-1-mediated signal attenuation in tumor-specific T cells, enabling enhanced proliferation and cytokine production. However, acquired resistance emerges rapidly in some patients, suggesting that additional immune escape mechanisms are engaged following checkpoint blockade. Understanding the expression patterns and functional status of genes in the ten programs identified above may enable identification of patients most likely to benefit from checkpoint blockade and may reveal combination therapy approaches targeting complementary immune escape mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis comprehensive analysis of 144 lymphocyte-associated genes in the context of astrocytoma reveals a remarkably coordinated set of gene programs governing immune cell development, trafficking, activation, and effector function. The exceptional representation of TCR signaling components, cytotoxic effector molecules, adhesion molecules, and transcriptional regulators indicates that the tissue source of this gene list contained cells primed for rapid anti-tumor responses. In the context of astrocytoma, these genes represent the molecular foundation of anti-tumor immunity, and their expression patterns should reflect the activity state and differentiation stage of infiltrating lymphocytes. The identification of ten distinct but functionally integrated gene programs provides a framework for interpreting gene expression data from astrocytoma specimens and for predicting responses to immunotherapy. Future studies employing single-cell transcriptomics, multiparameter flow cytometry, and spatial analysis should systematically characterize the expression patterns of genes in these programs across the spectrum of astrocytoma grades and histologies, and should correlate program expression with clinical outcomes and responses to immunotherapy. Such studies are likely to reveal novel therapeutic targets and predictive biomarkers that can guide personalized immunotherapy strategies for astrocytoma patients.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n  \"title\": \"Gene Program Functional Analysis: Lymphocyte Biology in Astrocytoma\",\n  \"description\": \"Comprehensive literature-based functional analysis identifying ten gene programs relevant to immune surveillance and anti-tumor immunity in astrocytoma.
