The analysis identifies nine major gene programs that collectively orchestrate neural progenitor maintenance, synaptic remodeling, metabolic adaptation, and neoplastic transformation. Key findings indicate that these genes regulate a spectrum of cellular states ranging from stem-like neural progenitors to differentiated neurons, with profound dysregulation observed in recurrent and therapy-resistant tumors. Multiple gene programs show evidence of metabolic rewiring, particularly through IDH1-driven alterations in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glutaminolysis, concurrent with activation of inflammatory pathways and alterations in cell adhesion and synaptic connectivity. The analysis emphasizes that high-grade astrocytomas display a complex interplay between programs normally ensuring proper neural development and those supporting tumor cell plasticity and invasion.\n\n## Biological Context and Astrocytoma Pathobiology\n\n### Overview of Astrocytoma and Its Molecular Landscape\n\nAstrocytomas represent a heterogeneous group of central nervous system tumors arising from astrocytes or their precursors, with grading ranging from low-grade diffuse astrocytomas to high-grade glioblastomas according to the 2021 World Health Organization classification[4]. The molecular subtyping now emphasizes isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status, with IDH-mutant astrocytomas typically showing a more favorable prognosis than IDH-wildtype tumors[4]. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that eflornithine plus lomustine provides clinically meaningful improvements in overall survival for patients with recurrent IDH-mutant grade 3 astrocytomas, doubling progression-free survival from 7.2 to 15.8 months, highlighting the importance of understanding molecular drivers in these tumors[4][55]. The peritumoral region surrounding gliomas displays profound alterations in neuronal properties, including enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission and aberrant intrinsic neuronal characteristics that precede seizure onset, indicating extensive remodeling of neural circuits[24].\n\nAt the single-cell level, high-grade gliomas exhibit remarkable cellular heterogeneity with distinct transcriptional states ranging from oligodendrocyte progenitor-like (OPC-like) cells to mesenchymal stem-like cells (MES-like), astrocyte-like (AC-like), and neural progenitor-like (NPC-like) populations[18][51]. Recent single-cell and spatial transcriptomic studies have revealed that pericytes function as the most active paracrine signaling hub within the tumor parenchyma, orchestrating a tumor-restraining microenvironment through interactions with both glioma cells and immune cells[18][51]. Critically, genomic studies of pediatric high-grade gliomas using comprehensive mouse models have identified distinct driver mutations including BRAF V600E, FGFR1/FGFR3 fusions, PDGFRA mutations, and NTRK fusions, each generating tumors with distinct histopathological and molecular characteristics[3].\n\n### Metabolic and Transcriptional Reorganization in Astrocytomas\n\nRecent metabolomic and transcriptomic profiling has unveiled a distinct metabolic signature in recurrent and radiation-resistant astrocytomas characterized by elevated IDH1 activity, enhanced tricarboxylic acid cycle flux, and altered glutaminolysis[14][39]. The expression of key metabolic enzymes including IDH1, hexokinase 2 (HK2), heat shock proteins (HSPH1), glutaminase (GLS), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L1) is specifically concentrated in progenitor-like and cycling neural progenitor populations within recurrent tumors[14][39]. These metabolic alterations are coupled with chromatin restructuring involving altered accessibility at metabolic gene loci and a shift in gene regulatory networks favoring pluripotency and metabolic autonomy despite oxygen depletion[14][39]. Single-cell analysis has established that the progenitor-photoreceptor cluster, characterized by elevated SOX6, TCF4, and TEAD1 expression, represents a key cell state expanded in recurrent tumors and intimately linked to metabolic reprogramming and radiation resistance[14][39].\n\n---\n\n## Gene Program 1: Neural Progenitor Maintenance and Stemness\n\n### Program Description and Biological Function\n\nThe neural progenitor maintenance program represents a cohesive regulatory network controlling the balance between neural stem cell (NSC) self-renewal and differentiation, operating through a combination of transcription factors, chromatin remodeling complexes, and signaling pathways that preserve multipotentiality. This program is anchored by the transcription factors SOX2, SOX6, SOX4, and SOX11, which collectively establish and maintain neural progenitor identity through both direct transcriptional control and chromatin state regulation[34]. The program incorporates OLIG2, a master regulator of oligodendrocyte lineage specification that in progenitor contexts maintains the capacity for lineage switching, alongside RBPJ, which mediates Notch signaling-dependent control of progenitor-to-differentiating cell transitions[25][67]. Chromatin remodeling is facilitated through members of the SWI/SNF family and related complexes, though not all core components appear in the input gene list, suggesting partial representation within the provided dataset[3].\n\nThe program extends to include genes regulating fundamental progenitor functions including cell cycle regulation (HES6, a Notch target and direct repressor of pro-neural factors), neurosphere formation and maintenance, and the suppression of differentiation signals. Notably, the neural progenitor program appears dysregulated in astrocytomas, with single-cell analyses demonstrating that recurrent tumors expand populations expressing progenitor markers (SOX6, TCF4, TEAD1) alongside metabolic enzymes (IDH1, HK2, GLS, NFE2L1)[14][39]. This expansion of a progenitor-like state is thought to confer both metabolic flexibility and enhanced stemness properties including increased self-renewal capacity and resistance to differentiation-inducing therapies[14][39].\n\n### Atomic Biological Processes and Cellular Components\n\nWithin the neural progenitor maintenance program, several distinguishable atomic processes emerge: **(1) Stem cell self-renewal and symmetrical cell division** is mediated through Notch signaling (RBPJ target genes downstream of DLL1 and DLL3), Wnt signaling components, and suppression of pro-neuronal transcription factors via HES6; **(2) Lineage competence maintenance** involves the balance of SOX family factors maintaining multi-lineage potential while suppressing premature differentiation; **(3) Proliferation control** operates through cell cycle checkpoint proteins (RBPJ regulates E2F targets); and **(4) Metabolic support of progenitor state** through altered metabolic enzyme expression (IDH1, HK2, GLS) that supports anabolic biosynthesis required for proliferation[14][39].\n\nCellular components include the **apical complex** with associated adherens junctions containing proteins like CTNNA2 (α-catenin), which anchors neural progenitors to the apical surface where they receive Notch and Wnt signals from neighboring cells and the apical membrane organization, and the **chromatin landscape** characterized by specific histone modifications that maintain an \"open\" or poised chromatin state at both stem cell genes and developmental regulators.\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impact in Astrocytoma\n\nIn the context of astrocytoma, dysregulation of the neural progenitor maintenance program manifests as: **(1) Sustained stemness despite differentiation signals**, allowing tumor cells to resist standard chemotherapy approaches that rely on differentiation induction; **(2) Expanded self-renewal capacity** beyond normal physiological limits, enabling continuous tumor growth and recurrence after initial therapy; **(3) Metabolic adaptation** to support both proliferation and stemness, utilizing elevated glycolysis (HK2) and glutaminolysis (GLS) as central metabolic hubs; and **(4) Lineage plasticity** that permits dynamic transitions between oligodendrocyte progenitor-like and neural progenitor-like states in response to microenvironmental signals.\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nThe centrality of the neural progenitor program to astrocytoma biology is supported by multiple lines of convergent evidence. Single-cell transcriptomic studies of primary and recurrent medulloblastomas and high-grade gliomas have consistently identified that populations expressing SOX2, SOX6, SOX4, and OLIG2 represent cycling progenitor compartments that expand with tumor recurrence and radiation resistance[14][39]. These progenitor-like cells are characterized by elevated expression of HES6, TCF4, TEAD1, and metabolic enzymes (IDH1, HK2, GLS), indicating a state that combines stemness markers with metabolic reprogramming[14][39]. The TEAD family of transcription factors, while not extensively detailed in the search results for this specific context, are known mediators of Hippo pathway signaling and control stemness-associated gene programs[14]. Functional studies demonstrate that knockdown of IDH1, which is highly expressed in progenitor-like populations, significantly reduces neurosphere growth and self-renewal capacity, indicating that metabolic rewiring through this enzyme is essential for maintaining the stem cell-like state[39].\n\nThe temporal dynamics of progenitor gene expression also support the program's role in tumor biology: comparison of primary and recurrent tumor samples shows that genes characteristic of multipotent neural progenitors (SOX6, TCF4, TEAD1) are selectively elevated in recurrent lesions despite their absence or reduced expression in primary tumors[14]. This selective expansion suggests that therapy (radiation, chemotherapy, surgical resection) creates selective pressure favoring preservation or expansion of cells retaining progenitor characteristics. Furthermore, the co-expression of progenitor markers with genes associated with pluripotency (noted in pathway enrichment analyses) and the simultaneous upregulation of metabolic enzymes suggests a tightly coordinated program in which stemness maintenance and metabolic autonomy are functionally linked[14][39].\n\n### Significance Score: 0.92\n\nThe high significance score reflects the presence of nearly all canonical neural progenitor transcription factors (SOX2, SOX6, SOX4, SOX11, OLIG2), Notch pathway effectors (RBPJ, with DLL1 and DLL3 present), and metabolic modulators, alongside strong literature support demonstrating that progenitor-like states are specifically enriched in recurrent and therapy-resistant tumors. The program's relevance to the astrocytoma context is further elevated by the demonstrated functional impact of IDH1 on progenitor cell properties.\n\n### Supporting Genes\n\nSOX2, SOX6, SOX4, SOX11, OLIG2, RBPJ, HES6, DLL1, DLL3, TEAD1 (TCF4), IDH1, HK2, GLS, NFE2L1, HSPH1, CTNNA2, TCF4 (implied in enrichment analyses)\n\n### Required Genes Not in Input\n\nThe program would benefit from inclusion of **TP53**, **PTEN**, and **NF1**, which are critical regulators of neural progenitor maintenance and are frequently mutated in astrocytomas[3]. Additional components include core stem cell transcription factors like **POU5F1** (OCT4), **NANOG**, and **KLF4**, which are typically active in pluripotent contexts, and chromatin remodeling complex members including **BAF53A** and **BAF60** that execute SOX family-mediated chromatin remodeling. The Wnt signaling pathway (involving **AXIN2**, **GSK3β**, **β-catenin/CTNNB1**) is also critical but only partially represented through CTNNA2.\n\n### Citations\n\n- **[14]**: Single-cell multi-omics study identifying elevated SOX6, TCF4, TEAD1, IDH1, HK2, HSPH1, GLS, NFE2L1 in recurrent tumor progenitor_photoreceptor clusters\n- **[39]**: Demonstrates that IDH1 expression is concentrated in progenitor_photoreceptor clusters and that IDH1 knockdown reduces neurosphere growth and self-renewal\n- **[3]**: Mouse models showing PDGFRA-driven gliomagenesis independent of ATRX and histone mutations\n- **[43]**: Upregulation of neural stem cell maintenance pathways and E2F signaling (cell proliferation) in chronic phases of CNS injury, relevant to understanding sustained progenitor states\n\n---\n\n## Gene Program 2: Synaptic Adhesion and Neurexin-Neuroligin Signaling\n\n### Program Description and Biological Function\n\nThe synaptic adhesion program encompasses the molecular machinery mediating intercellular communication through synaptic contacts, centered on the trans-synaptic adhesion complexes formed by neurexins (NRXN1) and neuroligins (NLGN4X), supplemented by additional cell adhesion molecules and associated signaling proteins. Neurexins, particularly NRXN1, are presynaptic cell adhesion molecules that undergo complex alternative splicing and bind postsynaptic neuroligins and other ligands, transducing signals that regulate presynaptic function, neurotransmitter release probability, and synaptic efficacy[17][44]. The neuroligin family (represented by NLGN4X in the input list) binds neurexins and recruits postsynaptic scaffolding proteins, linking synaptic adhesion to postsynaptic signal transduction[17].\n\nThe program further incorporates additional adhesion molecules including CADM2 (cell adhesion molecule, involved in synapse organization), contactins (CNTN1, CNTN3) which mediate both homophilic and heterophilic adhesion and are crucial for nodal clustering and axonal organization, and contactin-associated proteins (CNTNAP2), which are integral to paranodal junction organization and synaptic function[24]. The program extends to include signaling molecules downstream of neurexin-neuroligin interactions, including components of proteolytic cascades involving α-secretases (particularly ADAM10 and ADAM17) and γ-secretases, which generate bioactive intracellular fragments that regulate LIMK/cofilin signaling and dendritic spine formation[17].\n\nNotably, the program includes genes encoding scaffolding proteins (DLGAP1) that link postsynaptic density components and facilitate signal transduction from adhesion complexes to intracellular signaling cascades. The presence of regulatory molecules like MDGA2 (a negative regulator of neurexin-neuroligin trans-synaptic signaling) further enriches the program's regulatory capacity, allowing fine-tuning of synaptic strength and connectivity patterns.\n\n### Atomic Biological Processes and Cellular Components\n\nThe synaptic adhesion program comprises several distinguishable atomic processes: **(1) Trans-synaptic adhesion and recognition**, mediated by NRXN1 binding to neuroligins and concurrent interactions with auxiliary adhesion molecules like contactins; **(2) Synaptic proteolysis and signaling**, involving sequential cleavage of adhesion molecules by α-secretases (particularly ADAM10, ADAM17) and γ-secretases, generating bioactive intracellular fragments; **(3) Postsynaptic density organization**, through DLGAP1 and related scaffolding proteins that organize PSD components and couple adhesion to receptor signaling; **(4) Dendritic spine formation and maintenance**, downstream of neuroligin-mediated signaling through LIMK/cofilin pathway activation; and **(5) Paranodal junction organization**, mediated by CNTNAP2 and related contactin-associated proteins.\n\nCellular components include the **presynaptic terminal** containing NRXN1, the **postsynaptic density** containing neuroligins, DLGAP1, and postsynaptic glutamate receptors (GRIA2, GRIA4), the **adhesion junction proper** where trans-synaptic cell-cell contacts are established, and the **dendritic spine** as the morphological substrate for these contacts, including the spine cytoplasm where LIMK/cofilin cascades operate.\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impact in Astrocytoma\n\nIn the context of astrocytoma, alterations in synaptic adhesion programs manifest as: **(1) Remodeling of glioma cell-neuron interactions**, allowing glioma cells to form ectopic synaptic-like contacts with peritumoral neurons or to express synaptic adhesion machinery previously restricted to differentiated neurons (glioma cells have been shown to express synaptic genes and form connections with neurons[24]); **(2) Enhanced intercellular communication** through neuroligin-neurexin complexes that may facilitate glioma cell aggregation or communication with the tumor microenvironment; **(3) Activation of calcium signaling cascades** downstream of synaptic adhesion, potentially supporting tumor cell migration, invasion, or survival through mimicry of normal developmental signaling; and **(4) Altered proteolysis of adhesion molecules**, generating bioactive fragments that may promote epithelial-mesenchymal-like transition or enhance tumor cell motility.\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nThe synaptic adhesion program's relevance to astrocytoma biology is underscored by multiple complementary observations. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of peritumoral cortex from glioma patients with tumor-associated seizures revealed a distinct set of differentially expressed genes in tumor-associated seizure (TAS) patients compared to non-TAS patients, with multiple genes implicated in synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity upregulated in the seizure-prone state[24]. Specifically, genes encoding synaptic adhesion molecules and components of the postsynaptic density were identified as significantly dysregulated in peritumoral neurons adjacent to gliomas. Furthermore, studies of social memory maintenance in mice have demonstrated that neurexin-neuroligin signaling, operating through ADAM10-mediated proteolysis of neuroligin-1 (NLG1), is critical for maintaining long-term potentiation and synaptic transmission strength[17].\n\nThe observation that glioma cells develop ectopic contacts with peritumoral neurons and express synaptic molecules previously considered neuron-specific represents a profound remodeling of synaptic adhesion programs during glioma development[24]. Peritumoral neurons demonstrate enhanced excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes when recorded in the context of gliomas, indicating that glioma-neuron interactions substantially remodel synaptic strength[24]. These findings collectively suggest that glioma cells co-opt or aberrantly activate synaptic adhesion programs normally ensuring proper neural circuit organization, thereby creating novel cellular interfaces and potentially disrupting normal peri-tumoral circuit function.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of synaptic molecules like GRID2 (glutamate receptor delta-2), which is typically found at cerebellar parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses, in glioma transcriptomes suggests that glioma cells acquire or reactivate synaptic-specific gene expression patterns that may be normally suppressed in glial cells.\n\n### Significance Score: 0.85\n\nThe significance score reflects a comprehensive set of synaptic adhesion molecules (NRXN1, NLGN4X, CADM2, CNTN1, CNTN3, CNTNAP2, DLGAP1) and strong literature evidence for dysregulation of these molecules in the peritumoral environment and glioma cells themselves.

AMPA receptors, composed of GluA subunits (GRIA2, GRIA4), mediate the fast component of excitatory postsynaptic responses and undergo activity-dependent trafficking that underlies long-term potentiation (LTP) and synaptic plasticity[13]. Kainate receptors (GRIK2, GRID2) exhibit distinct pharmacology and gating kinetics compared to AMPA receptors and mediate both postsynaptic and presynaptic functions, regulating excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter release and modulating synaptic excitability[13].\n\nThe program incorporates regulatory factors controlling receptor function and trafficking, including the protein kinase C (PRKCA) family, which phosphorylates both AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits to modulate their gating properties and surface expression. Additionally, the program includes calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a critical mediator of activity-dependent receptor trafficking and phosphorylation of GluA1 at serine 831 (S831), which is considered a hallmark of LTP formation and expression[17]. Notably, while CaMKII is not in the input gene list, its targets and interacting proteins are well-represented, indicating the program's functional coherence.\n\nThe program extends to include postsynaptic density components (DLGAP1) that organize glutamate receptors at synaptic sites, and presynaptic components (ADAM22, a transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory protein interacting with synaptic adhesion molecules). The presence of scaffolding proteins and regulatory kinases collectively enables the program to support the full spectrum of glutamatergic synaptic function, from basal transmission to activity-dependent plasticity.\n\n### Atomic Biological Processes and Cellular Components\n\nWithin the glutamatergic synaptic transmission program, multiple distinguishable atomic processes emerge: **(1) Fast excitatory synaptic transmission**, mediated by GluA-containing AMPA receptors that form the primary route for glutamate-evoked depolarization at most central synapses; **(2) Modulation of synaptic strength**, through AMPA receptor subunit composition changes and phosphorylation-dependent gating modifications; **(3) Activity-dependent receptor trafficking**, governed by CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of GluA1 (S831) and by interaction with PDZ-domain scaffolds like DLGAP1; **(4) Kainate receptor-mediated regulation**, distinct from AMPA-mediated transmission but contributing to synaptic integration and plasticity; **(5) Desensitization and recovery**, representing intrinsic gating properties that determine synaptic kinetics and fidelity; and **(6) Postsynaptic density organization**, clustering glutamate receptors at synaptic sites through multivalent interactions with scaffolding proteins.\n\nCellular components include the **postsynaptic density**, a specialized membrane region enriched in glutamate receptors, scaffolding proteins, and signaling enzymes; the **dendritic spine**, the morphological substrate for glutamatergic synapses; the **extrasynaptic plasma membrane**, containing glutamate receptors that mediate extrasynaptic calcium signaling; and the **presynaptic terminal**, which in the context of kainate receptors contains presynaptic-type kainate receptors that regulate neurotransmitter release.\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impact in Astrocytoma\n\nIn astrocytoma, dysregulation of the glutamatergic synaptic transmission program manifests as: **(1) Enhanced excitatory drive on peritumoral neurons**, contributing to the well-documented phenomenon of glioma-associated seizures through heightened synaptic excitation; **(2) Altered glutamate homeostasis**, as glioma cells are known to secrete elevated glutamate levels that activate peritumoral neuronal glutamate receptors through non-synaptic mechanisms; **(3) Remodeling of peritumoral neuronal properties**, with increased excitatory synaptic strength (EPSC amplitudes) and altered intrinsic excitability phenotypes that promote seizure generation; **(4) Activation of excitotoxic cascades**, through sustained glutamate receptor activation that may promote neuronal loss in the peritumoral environment; and **(5) Aberrant plasticity mechanisms**, in which tumor-induced activation of CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation pathways and AMPA receptor trafficking may occur outside of normal developmental or learning contexts, potentially serving pro-tumor functions.\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nThe glutamatergic synaptic transmission program's role in astrocytoma pathobiology is substantiated by convergent evidence from multiple studies. Peritumoral cortex recordings from glioma patients demonstrate significantly elevated EPSC amplitudes in the glioma patient cohort, indicating increased glutamatergic synaptic strength[24]. Computational modeling of cortical circuits has revealed that cortical neurons are highly susceptible to synaptic perturbations induced by glioma proximity, with modeling studies showing that relatively small changes in synaptic strength or intrinsic properties can generate paroxysmal depolarizing shifts (PDS) characteristic of seizure activity[24]. \n\nSingle-cell transcriptomic analysis of peritumoral neurons identified significant upregulation of genes encoding components of synaptic transmission and plasticity in the seizure-prone state, with multiple ionotropic glutamate receptor genes showing altered expression patterns[24]. The mechanism underlying enhanced glutamate receptor activation involves both synaptic and non-synaptic routes: glioma cells express and secrete elevated levels of glutamate through altered metabolism (particularly glutaminolysis through GLS) and through impaired glutamate reuptake due to reduced expression of the glial glutamate transporter EAAT2 in glioma-associated glial cells[24].\n\nFurthermore, the observation that glioma cells express synaptic molecules and form ectopic contacts with peritumoral neurons suggests that tumor cells may directly activate postsynaptic glutamate receptors on neurons through a quasi-synaptic mechanism, thereby enhancing glutamatergic synaptic transmission[24]. This represents a profound remodeling of glutamatergic circuits, wherein tumor cells exploit normal developmental mechanisms for establishing excitatory synapses.\n\n### Significance Score: 0.82\n\nThe significance score reflects a solid representation of AMPA receptor (GRIA2, GRIA4) and kainate receptor (GRIK2, GRID2) subunits, along with postsynaptic density components (DLGAP1) and regulatory proteins. However, the input list lacks critical components including NMDA receptors (GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and proteins regulating glutamate reuptake, which limits the score somewhat.\n\n### Supporting Genes\n\nGRIA2, GRIA4, GRIK2, GRID2, DLGAP1, ADAM22, PRKCA, CaMKII (not in input but central to program function)\n\n### Required Genes Not in Input\n\n**GRIN1**, **GRIN2A**, **GRIN2B** (NMDA receptor subunits; NMDA receptors interact allosterically with AMPA receptors and are critical for LTP), **CAMK2A**, **CAMK2B**, **CAMK2G**, **CAMK2D** (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases mediating activity-dependent receptor trafficking), **SYN1**, **SYN2** (synapsins regulating neurotransmitter release), **EAAT2**, **GLT1** (glutamate transporters maintaining synaptic glutamate homeostasis), **MAPK1**, **MAPK3** (ERK1/2 kinases downstream of glutamate receptor signaling), and **SHANK3** (PSD scaffolding protein).\n\n### Citations\n\n- **[13]**: Structural insights into kainate receptor desensitization; demonstrates that KARs undergo large conformational changes upon desensitization distinct from AMPA receptors\n- **[24]**: Peritumoral neurons in glioma patients show significantly elevated EPSC amplitudes and dysregulated synaptic transmission genes; computational modeling shows neurons are highly susceptible to synaptic and dendritic perturbations inducing PDS\n\n---\n\n## Gene Program 4: Tumor Microenvironment Remodeling and Immune Evasion\n\n### Program Description and Biological Function\n\nThe tumor microenvironment remodeling program encompasses secreted and membrane-associated molecules that glioma cells and associated stromal cells employ to reshape the local tissue environment, dampen immune surveillance, and promote tumor progression. This program includes genes encoding adhesion molecules that promote glioma cell-stromal interactions (CDH2, CDH10, CDH13, CDH20), secreted proteins regulating inflammation and angiogenesis (VCAN, TNR), and complement-related proteins or their ligands (as inferred from pathway analyses). The program further incorporates genes encoding sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) and their ligands, which mediate immune evasion through engagement of inhibitory pathways on myeloid cells[54].\n\nWhile not all components are present in the input gene list, the program includes factors that promote or suppress specific immune cell states within the tumor microenvironment. For instance, secreted factors from glioma cells (particularly tumor mesenchymal stem-like cells) alter the conditioning of the tumor microenvironment through production of complement component 5a (C5a) and related mediators, which shape macrophage polarization toward a pro-tumoral phenotype[29].\n\nThe program extends to include cell adhesion molecules that mediate interactions between glioma cells and endothelial cells, facilitating vessel co-option and enabling glioma cell invasion through a process resembling normal developmental glioma progenitor cell migration along blood vessels. These interactions involve integrins and other adhesion molecules (represented by ITGB1 in the input list), which engage with extracellular matrix proteins (collagens, VCAN, etc.).\n\n### Atomic Biological Processes and Cellular Components\n\nThe tumor microenvironment remodeling program comprises several distinguishable atomic processes: **(1) Extracellular matrix remodeling**, mediated by secreted proteases (matrix metalloproteinases, though not all are in the input list) and structural proteins (VCAN, TNR, COL11A1); **(2) Immune evasion signaling**, through complement component production and engagement of Siglec inhibitory pathways on macrophages and other myeloid cells; **(3) Macrophage polarization and pro-tumoral phenotype induction**, through secreted factors (C5a, IL-8, SPP1) that promote macrophage-derived support for angiogenesis and tumor progression; **(4) Vascular interactions and angiogenesis regulation**, through VEGF-related signaling and interactions between glioma cells and endothelial cells; **(5) Adhesion-mediated communication** between glioma cells and stromal cells; and **(6) Inflammatory cytokine signaling**, particularly IL-6 and TNF-α pathways that maintain a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment despite immune evasion[21].\n\nCellular components include the **extracellular matrix**, a three-dimensional network of proteins and proteoglycans that supports cell migration and cell-cell communication; **endothelial cells** forming the tumor vasculature; **macrophages and other myeloid cells** within the tumor microenvironment; and the **perivascular niche**, a specialized microenvironment at the interface between tumor cells and blood vessels characterized by high concentrations of pericytes and immune cells.\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impact in Astrocytoma\n\nIn astrocytoma, dysregulation of the tumor microenvironment remodeling program manifests as: **(1) Enhanced glioma cell-endothelial cell interactions**, facilitating vessel co-option wherein glioma cells migrate along blood vessel surfaces, enabling dissemination within the white matter and enhanced drug resistance due to proximity to blood-brain barrier; **(2) Macrophage polarization toward pro-tumoral phenotypes**, associated with production of angiogenic factors (VEGF), growth factors, and immunosuppressive cytokines; **(3) Suppression of anti-tumor immunity**, through C5a-mediated signaling on macrophages and engagement of inhibitory Siglec pathways; **(4) Remodeling of the extracellular matrix**, promoting glioma cell migration and invasion through altered collagen organization and increased matrix protease activity; and **(5) Angiogenesis and vascular dysfunction**, characterized by microvascular proliferation and abnormal endothelial function that paradoxically promotes glioma progression while also creating hypoxic niches.\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nThe tumor microenvironment remodeling program's centrality to glioma progression is demonstrated by multiple complementary findings. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of glioblastomas identified pericytes as the most actively communicating cell type within the tumor parenchyma, orchestrating a complex paracrine signaling network with both glioma cells and immune cells[18][51]. Pericyte depletion in transgenic mouse models of high-grade glioma led to paradoxical increases in tumor progression, associated with dysregulated endothelial cell proliferation, reduced blood-brain barrier integrity, increased vessel co-option of glioma cells, and altered immune cell composition with marked expansion of pro-tumoral macrophages[18][51].\n\nThe complement pathway, particularly the C5a-C5aR1 axis, has emerged as a central regulator of glioma-associated immune suppression[29]. Glioma tumorspheres cultured in conditioned medium enriched in C5a (secreted by tumor mesenchymal stem-like cells) showed enhanced proliferation, invasion, and stemness properties, all of which were reversed by C5a antagonism[29]. These effects were mediated through macrophage polarization toward an SPP1+ pro-tumoral phenotype, with corresponding upregulation of angiogenic pathways including VEGF signaling[29]. In vivo xenograft studies confirmed that C5a-enriched conditioned medium promoted tumor growth and reduced survival, while C5aR1 antagonism (via W54011) decreased tumor size and improved survival, suggesting direct therapeutic potential.\n\nThe role of Siglec-mediated immune evasion in cancer has been demonstrated in colorectal cancer models, where the LGALS3BP-Siglec-14 axis shapes the tumor microenvironment by promoting macrophage polarization toward an immunosuppressive phenotype[54]. While this work was performed in colorectal cancer, the pathway components are conserved and likely operative in gliomas given the presence of similar immune cell populations and sialic acid-decorated tumor cells.\n\n### Significance Score: 0.78\n\nThe significance score reflects a comprehensive set of cell adhesion and extracellular matrix genes (CDH2, CDH10, CDH13, CDH20, VCAN, TNR, COL11A1, ITGB1) alongside evidence of dysregulation in the glioma microenvironment. However, the input list lacks critical immune modulator components including complement factors, cytokines, and key macrophage polarization effectors (SPP1, IL-8, IL-6, TNF-α, VEGF), which limits the score.\n\n### Supporting Genes\n\nCDH2, CDH10, CDH13, CDH20, VCAN, TNR, COL11A1, ITGB1, TMEFF2 (potential immune modulator), FAM110B (tissue remodeling-associated), ADAMTS6, ADAMTS19 (extracellular matrix proteases)\n\n### Required Genes Not in Input\n\n**C5A**, **C5AR1** (complement pathway), **IL6**, **TNF**, **IL8** (pro-inflammatory cytokines), **VEGFA**, **VEGFB** (angiogenic factors), **SPP1** (osteopontin; macrophage polarization factor), **CSF1**, **CSF1R** (macrophage recruitment and differentiation), **IL4**, **IL10** (anti-inflammatory cytokines promoting macrophage polarization), **TGFB1** (broad immunomodulatory roles), **CD8A**, **CD4** (T cell markers), **CD206**, **MRC1** (macrophage markers), and **IDO1** (tryptophan catabolism-based immune suppression).\n\n### Citations\n\n- **[18]**: Single-cell transcriptomic analysis identifies pericytes as the most active paracrine signaling hub; pericyte depletion increases tumor progression through dysregulated endothelial and immune cell compartments\n- **[51]**: Pericyte depletion leads to remodeled perivascular niche with dysregulated vessel growth, reduced BBB integrity, increased vessel co-option, and altered immune-suppressive macrophage abundance\n- **[29]**: C5a-enriched conditioned medium from tumor mesenchymal stem-like cells promotes GBM tumorsphere proliferation, invasion, and stemness; effects reversed by C5aR1 antagonism; altered macrophage phenotype and angiogenic pathways\n- **[54]**: Siglec-14-LGALS3BP axis shapes tumor microenvironment by promoting pro-tumoral macrophage phenotype and angiogenesis in cancer models\n\n---\n\n## Gene Program 5: Metabolic Reprogramming and Altered Energy Metabolism\n\n### Program Description and Biological Function\n\nThe metabolic reprogramming program represents a coordinated shift in cellular energy production and biosynthetic pathways, enabling glioma cells to support both proliferation and stemness through altered flux through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glutaminolysis, glycolysis, and lipogenesis. The program is anchored by isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), which catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and simultaneously generates NADPH, a critical cofactor for anabolic biosynthesis and antioxidant defense[39]. The program further incorporates hexokinase 2 (HK2), which catalyzes the first committed step of glycolysis and is often upregulated in tumors to support rapid glucose consumption for both ATP and biosynthetic precursors[39].\n\nGlutaminase (GLS), which catalyzes conversion of glutamine to glutamate and ammonia, supports both oxidative glutaminolysis (driving TCA cycle flux through reductive carboxylation) and non-oxidative glutaminolysis (generating glutamate for biosynthesis, neurotransmitter synthesis, and amino acid synthesis)[39]. Heat shock proteins (HSPH1, HSP90, etc.) serve multiple roles including protein folding and stabilization of oncogenic signaling proteins. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2/NRF2), a master regulator of antioxidant response elements, controls the expression of antioxidant enzymes and metabolic detoxification proteins[39].\n\nThe program also encompasses transport proteins facilitating glucose and amino acid entry (SLC family members in the input list), including SLC2A13 (glucose transporter), SLC24A3 (calcium/potassium exchanger potentially involved in metabolic ion homeostasis), and SLC44A5 (organic cation transporter). The integration of these metabolic pathways enables glioma cells to maintain energy production despite varying oxygen and nutrient availability, supporting the well-documented metabolic flexibility of these tumors.\n\n### Atomic Biological Processes and Cellular Components\n\nThe metabolic reprogramming program comprises several distinguishable atomic processes: **(1) Glycolysis and glucose metabolism**, mediated by HK2 and other glycolytic enzymes; **(2) TCA cycle flux and oxidative phosphorylation**, regulated by IDH1, succinate dehydrogenase, and related enzymes; **(3) Glutaminolysis and amino acid metabolism**, mediated by GLS and transaminases; **(4) Reductive carboxylation**, an alternative pathway wherein IDH1 operates in the reductive direction to generate acetyl-CoA and isocitrate from α-KG, particularly active under hypoxic conditions or when oxidative capacity is limited; **(5) Lipogenesis**, supporting membrane biosynthesis for tumor cell proliferation and potentially membrane trafficking in axon-like structures formed by some glioma cells; **(6) Antioxidant defense**, through NRF2-mediated upregulation of glutathione synthesis, catalase, and other detoxification enzymes; **(7) Amino acid transport and biosynthesis**, supporting the production of glutamate, aspartate, and other amino acids needed for biosynthesis and signaling; and **(8) One-carbon metabolism and epigenetic regulation**, wherein metabolic byproducts (α-KG-derived) directly influence histone and DNA methylation patterns, linking metabolism to epigenetic state.\n\nCellular components include the **mitochondrion**, the primary site of oxidative metabolism and TCA cycle operation; the **cytoplasm**, the site of glycolysis and reductive carboxylation; the **plasma membrane**, bearing glucose transporters and amino acid transporters; and the **nucleus**, wherein metabolic byproducts influence chromatin state and gene expression.\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impact in Astrocytoma\n\nIn astrocytoma, dysregulation of the metabolic reprogramming program manifests as: **(1) Enhanced proliferative capacity** through sustained ATP and biosynthetic precursor production despite oxygen and nutrient limitations; **(2) Altered metabolite utilization** favoring branched-chain amino acid catabolism and glutaminolysis as primary energy sources rather than oxidative glucose metabolism; **(3) Epigenetic plasticity**, through IDH1-dependent alterations in α-KG availability affecting histone and DNA methylation patterns, potentially enabling chromatin state transitions that support plasticity between tumor cell states; **(4) Radiation and chemotherapy resistance**, through enhanced antioxidant capacity (NRF2-driven) that protects against oxidative stress induced by genotoxic therapies; **(5) Hypoxia adaptation**, through metabolic rewiring supporting survival in low-oxygen niches within the tumor; and **(6) Maintenance of stemness**, through coordinated metabolic support of anabolic biosynthesis and reduced oxidative stress, both critical for stem cell self-renewal.\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nThe metabolic reprogramming program's central role in astrocytoma progression and therapy resistance is substantiated by comprehensive single-cell and bulk transcriptomic studies combined with functional metabolomic profiling. Metabolomic analysis of radiation-resistant medulloblastoma cell lines revealed elevated levels of citrate, acyl-carnitines, ADP, and other metabolites affiliated with IDH1 activity and altered TCA cycle flux, consistent with metabolic rewiring toward enhanced α-KG production and reductive carboxylation[39]. Critically, the expression of genes encoding these metabolic enzymes (IDH1, HK2, GLS, NFE2L1) was specifically concentrated within progenitor-like and cycling neural progenitor populations in recurrent patient samples, indicating that metabolic rewiring and stemness maintenance are functionally coupled[14][39].\n\nFunctional studies demonstrated that knockdown of IDH1 expression via shRNA in neural stem cells significantly reduced neurosphere proliferation and self-renewal capacity, indicating that IDH1 activity is essential for maintaining stem cell-like properties[39]. Furthermore, α-KG production was measured directly in parental, radiation-resistant, and IDH1-knockdown cells, confirming that IDH1 is a major source of elevated α-KG in radiation-resistant cell lines[39]. This elevated α-KG likely acts both as a TCA cycle intermediate supporting ATP production and as a cofactor for α-KG-dependent dioxygenases that regulate histone and DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and ultimately gene expression[39].\n\nThe temporal and spatial organization of metabolic gene expression further supports the program's role: the expression of IDH1 is concentrated within specific tumor cell states (progenitor_photoreceptor clusters) rather than uniformly distributed across all tumor cells, suggesting that metabolic rewiring is coupled to specific tumor cell phenotypes and may represent a defining feature of tumor-initiating or self-renewing cells[14][39]. Additionally, metabolic dysregulation in these populations encompasses multiple interconnected pathways (TCA cycle, glutamate metabolism, lipid metabolism, nucleotide biosynthesis), indicating a coordinated global metabolic reorganization rather than isolated enzyme alterations.\n\n### Significance Score: 0.88\n\nThe significance score reflects comprehensive representation of central metabolic enzymes and regulators (IDH1, HK2, GLS, NFE2L1, HSPH1), glucose and amino acid transporters (SLC2A13, SLC24A3, SLC44A5), and strong experimental evidence directly linking metabolic rewiring to stemness and radiation resistance.

This program is orchestrated by transcription factors including ZEB1 and ZEB2, which are classical EMT-inducing factors that repress epithelial genes (particularly E-cadherin/CDH1) and activate mesenchymal genes, and by SOX4, which can promote mesenchymal traits[31][18][51].\n\nThe program further incorporates adhesion molecules that characterize mesenchymal cell states, including N-cadherin (CDH2), which replaces E-cadherin during EMT and is associated with motility and invasion, and protocadherins (PCDH15, PCDH11X, CDH20) that support dynamic adhesion remodeling[31][49][51]. Loss of epithelial cell-cell adhesion is mediated through downregulation of epithelial markers and adherens junction proteins, with concomitant upregulation of mesenchymal-associated adhesion molecules and increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (represented in the input list by MMP16 and potentially others).\n\nThe program includes transcriptional regulation by NF-κB pathway components, which promote mesenchymal traits and stemness through upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mesenchymal markers (though NF-κB core components are not present in the input list)[22][62]. The program also encompasses genes supporting enhanced migratory capacity, including regulators of actin dynamics and cell polarity. Notably, the program operates in close association with metabolic rewiring, as mesenchymal cell states often display enhanced glycolysis and altered amino acid metabolism compared to epithelial states.\n\n### Atomic Biological Processes and Cellular Components\n\nThe EMT-like transition program comprises several distinguishable atomic processes: **(1) Transcriptional reprogramming**, mediated by ZEB1, ZEB2, SOX4, and associated transcription factors that coordinately suppress epithelial genes while activating mesenchymal genes; **(2) Loss of adherens junctions**, through downregulation of E-cadherin and associated junction proteins (though complete components not present in input list); **(3) Acquisition of mesenchymal adhesion molecules**, including N-cadherin, protocadherins, and integrins that support dynamic adhesion and migration; **(4) Enhanced migratory and invasive capacity**, through upregulation of actin-regulatory proteins and reduction of cell polarity; **(5) Metabolic switching**, toward enhanced glycolysis and altered amino acid metabolism; **(6) Increased stemness**, through expression of pluripotency-associated transcription factors and metabolic support of self-renewal; and **(7) Pro-inflammatory phenotype**, through activation of NF-κB and related inflammatory pathways.\n\nCellular components include the **plasma membrane**, bearing mesenchymal-type adhesion molecules and integrins; the **adherens junctions** undergoing remodeling; the **cytoskeleton**, particularly actin filaments and their regulatory proteins; and the **nucleus**, wherein transcriptional reprogramming occurs.\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impact in Astrocytoma\n\nIn astrocytoma, dysregulation of the EMT-like program manifests as: **(1) Enhanced invasion and infiltration**, wherein glioma cells acquire increased motility and ability to penetrate surrounding brain tissue; **(2) Loss of contact inhibition**, due to altered adherens junction dynamics; **(3) Increased stemness and plasticity**, enabling glioma cells to maintain self-renewal capacity during migration and colonization of new microenvironments; **(4) Heightened therapeutic resistance**, through combined effects of reduced differentiation and increased expression of multidrug resistance transporters; **(5) Promotion of metastatic potential**, though intra-CNS metastasis is rare, EMT-like traits support dissemination within brain parenchyma; and **(6) Enhanced immune evasion**, through altered expression of surface antigens and production of immunosuppressive factors associated with mesenchymal phenotypes.\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nThe EMT-like transition program's importance in glioma progression and therapy resistance is well-established through multiple complementary studies. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of glioblastomas has identified distinct mesenchymal-like (MES-like) tumor cell clusters that express markers associated with EMT and stem cell maintenance, including upregulation of mesenchymal genes (Fosl1, Met, Ccn4, Grb10, Sema3c) alongside stress-response genes (Hmox1, Tnc, Gdf15, Hspa9)[18][51]. These MES-like cell clusters showed increased transcription factor activity compared to other cell states, suggesting active transcriptional reprogramming[18][51].\n\nZEB1, a canonical EMT transcription factor, has been identified as a key regulator of glioma stemness and plasticity through its repression of differentiation-associated genes and activation of mesenchymal/pro-invasion programs[31]. The presence of mesenchymal gene signatures in recurrent tumors compared to primary tumors suggests that therapy (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy) selects for or promotes EMT-like cell states with enhanced survival and stemness properties[18][51].\n\nNotably, gene ontology analysis of mesenchymal tumor clusters revealed enrichment for stemness-associated gene sets, tumor cell plasticity, and genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), indicating a functional link between mesenchymal phenotypes and stemness[18][51]. The transcriptional factor analysis identified that MES II cells (a mesenchymal subset with particularly high stemness markers) express higher levels of transcriptional regulators including several associated with stemness and developmental plasticity[18][51].\n\n### Significance Score: 0.81\n\nThe significance score reflects strong representation of EMT-transcription factors (ZEB1, SOX4) and mesenchymal-associated adhesion molecules (CDH2, PCDH15, PCDH11X, CDH20), along with evidence that mesenchymal states are enriched in recurrent tumors.

This program is initiated through downregulation of stem cell maintenance genes (SOX2, OLIG2) and upregulation of neuronal specification factors (NEUROD1, ASCL1 pathway components, though not all are in the input list), followed by expression of neuronal differentiation markers and gradual acquisition of synapse-forming capability.\n\nThe program incorporates several tiers of neuronal maturation genes, beginning with early neuronal markers (DCX, which regulates microtubule dynamics during neurogenesis) and progressing through intermediate markers (MAPT, which encodes tau protein supporting axonal stability) and mature neuronal markers (ELAVL4, encoding an RNA-binding protein essential for neuronal activity-dependent gene expression; SOX11, a neuronal-specific transcription factor). The program includes genes supporting axonal and dendritic architecture, including microtubule-associated proteins (MAP2, critical for dendritic stability and branching), axon guidance and outgrowth genes (DPYSL3 homologs, neurofascin, etc.), and genes supporting synaptic development and function.\n\nThe program further encompasses voltage-gated ion channels characteristic of mature neurons (SCN1A, SCN3A, KCND2, KCNH8), which are essential for action potential generation and repolarization. Gene sets supporting GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission (GABRB3, GRIA2, GRIA4, GRIK2, GRID2) also contribute to defining the neuronal state. The presence of genes encoding structural proteins supporting neuronal morphology (neurofilaments, MAP2, etc.) further enriches the program's functional coverage.\n\n### Atomic Biological Processes and Cellular Components\n\nThe neuronal differentiation and maturation program comprises several distinguishable atomic processes: **(1) Neuronal lineage commitment**, through suppression of stem cell genes and upregulation of proneural factors; **(2) Axonogenesis**, involving microtubule stabilization, axon guidance molecule interactions, and establishment of axonal polarity; **(3) Dendritogenesis**, involving MAP2-dependent dendritic stability and branching, alongside dendritic spine formation; **(4) Synaptogenesis**, the formation of synaptic contacts through synaptic adhesion molecules and scaffolding proteins; **(5) Ion channel specification and expression**, establishing neuron-specific electrophysiological properties through subunit-specific channel composition; **(6) Activity-dependent gene expression**, through RNA-binding proteins (ELAVL4) that regulate translation of activity-dependent genes; **(7) Metabolic specialization**, wherein neurons adopt oxidative metabolism and reduced proliferation compared to progenitors; and **(8) Migration and positioning**, during cortical development wherein cortical neurons migrate radially along radial glial fibers to reach their final laminar positions.\n\nCellular components include the **axon**, a specialized neuronal process supporting long-distance communication; the **dendrite**, a branched process supporting local integration and synaptic contact; the **axon initial segment (AIS)**, the site of action potential initiation; the **synapse**, the specialized contact site for neurotransmission; and the **soma**, the neuronal cell body containing the nucleus and synthetic machinery.\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impact in Astrocytoma\n\nIn astrocytoma, the neuronal differentiation program is largely suppressed in tumor cells themselves, but aspects of the program are reactivated in the peritumoral tissue region. The predicted cellular impacts include: **(1) Suppression of neuronal differentiation in glioma cells**, maintaining tumor cell plasticity and capacity for self-renewal; **(2) Reactivation of neuronal-like traits in glioma cells cultured under certain conditions**, including expression of synaptic genes and morphological features resembling neurons (as observed in some glioma stem cell cultures); **(3) Remodeling of peritumoral neuronal populations**, wherein peritumoral neurons undergo activity-dependent alterations in gene expression including upregulation of genes supporting synaptic plasticity and neuronal homeostasis; **(4) Generation of aberrant peritumoral neuronal properties**, wherein peritumoral neurons acquire enhanced excitability and altered intrinsic membrane properties due to glioma-induced changes; and **(5) Potential neurotoxicity**, wherein peritumoral neurons undergo stress responses and apoptotic gene programs in response to glioma-derived factors.\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nThe neuronal differentiation program's complex role in astrocytoma is illustrated by multiple complementary observations. Peritumoral neurons in glioma-bearing mice display specific alterations in their intrinsic neuronal properties, with enhanced excitatory postsynaptic responses and altered action potential generation compared to neurons in normal brain tissue[24]. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of peritumoral L2/3 cortical neurons revealed a distinct set of differentially expressed genes in the tumor-associated seizure (TAS) state compared to non-seizure tumor-bearing mice, with multiple neuronal maturation genes showing altered expression patterns[24].\n\nNotably, the peritumoral cortex analysis revealed high expression of excitatory neuronal markers (glutamatergic and GABAergic markers) and undetectable levels of the proliferation marker Ki67, confirming that the profiled cells represented mature, post-mitotic neurons rather than recently generated immature neurons[24]. The fact that mature peritumoral neurons display activity-dependent alterations in gene expression (particularly genes involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity) indicates that gliomas induce remodeling of neuronal circuits through alterations in activity patterns and synaptic strength, potentially recruiting neuronal differentiation-related mechanisms for adaptation to the altered microenvironment.\n\nInterestingly, while peritumoral neurons maintain neuronal differentiation markers, glioma cells themselves often express synaptic genes typically restricted to differentiated neurons, suggesting that glioma cells aberrantly activate components of the neuronal differentiation program while simultaneously suppressing the full differentiation cascade that would render them non-proliferative[24].\n\n### Significance Score: 0.76\n\nThe significance score reflects solid representation of neuronal differentiation markers (DCX, MAPT, ELAVL4, SOX11, MAP2) and voltage-gated ion channels (SCN1A, SCN3A, KCND2, KCNH8), along with evidence that peritumoral neurons undergo activity-dependent alterations in neuronal gene expression. However, the input list lacks some key neuronal differentiation factors (NEUROD1, ASCL1, NeuroD4, neurogenin), which moderately limits the score.\n\n### Supporting Genes\n\nDCX, MAPT, ELAVL4, SOX11, MAP2, SCN1A, SCN3A, KCND2, KCNH8, GABRB3, GRIA2, GRIA4, GRIK2, GRID2, CADM2, CNTN1, CNTN3, NRXN1, NLGN4X\n\n### Required Genes Not in Input\n\n**NEUROD1**, **NEUROD4**, **ASCL1**, **NGN1**, **NGN2** (proneural bHLH factors driving neuronal commitment), **PAX6**, **OLIG2** (though OLIG2 is in input, additional context-specific functions in neurogenesis apply), **NeuroD2** (neuronal differentiation), **NeuN/RBFOX3** (neuronal mature marker), **SNAP25**, **VAMP2** (SNARE proteins for synaptic vesicle fusion), **SYN1**, **SYN2**, **SYT1** (synaptic vesicle proteins), **BDNF**, **NGF** (neurotrophic factors supporting neuronal survival and plasticity), **NFH**, **NFM**, **NFL** (neurofilament proteins supporting axonal architecture), **DPYSL3**, **DPYSL4** (collapsins regulating axon guidance), **ROBO1**, **SLIT2** (axon guidance), **L1CAM** (neurite outgrowth), **NCAM1** (neuronal adhesion molecule), **DNER** (dendritic glycoprotein), **NKX2-1**, **LMX1A** (transcription factors specifying neuronal subtypes), and **TBR1**, **CTIP2** (neuronal layer-specific transcription factors).\n\n### Citations\n\n- **[24]**: Peritumoral neurons show altered intrinsic neuronal properties and enhanced EPSC amplitudes; single-cell analysis confirms mature excitatory neuronal markers with undetectable proliferation markers; differential gene expression in TAS vs non-TAS states involving synaptic transmission genes\n- **[43]**: Sustained neural stem cell maintenance and upregulation of axonogenesis and neuronal stem cell maintenance pathways in chronic CNS injury\n\n---\n\n## Gene Program 8: Axon Guidance, Cell Migration, and Developmental Patterning\n\n### Program Description and Biological Function\n\nThe axon guidance and cell migration program encompasses molecular mechanisms directing neuronal growth cone navigation, cellular migration, and developmental patterning, which in the context of astrocytomas are aberrantly activated to facilitate glioma cell invasion and migration. This program is mediated by classical axon guidance molecules including Semaphorins (SEMA3A, likely present through enrichment analyses), their receptors, Slits and Robo signaling (though components are not fully present in the input list), and Ephrin-Eph signaling pathways. These molecules typically act through trans-cellular interactions to guide axonal pathfinding during neural development, establishing proper neural circuit architecture.\n\nThe program incorporates cell adhesion molecules that undergo dynamic remodeling during migration, including cadherins (CDH2, CDH10, CDH13, CDH20) and protocadherins, which balance cell-cell adhesion with the need for cellular motility. The program further includes regulatory molecules controlling actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cell polarity (PAK3, related Rho-family GTPases, though not comprehensively represented), which are essential for converting directional cues into cellular movement.\n\nThe program extends to include developmental patterning transcription factors (SOX genes, ZEB1, others) that establish anatomical coordinates during neural development and, when aberrantly expressed in gliomas, may promote invasion along developmental migration routes. The program integrates with the epithelial-mesenchymal-like transition program, as both involve enhanced motility and altered cell-cell adhesion, though the axon guidance program more specifically addresses directed migration along pre-existing tissue cues.\n\n### Atomic Biological Processes and Cellular Components\n\nThe axon guidance and cell migration program comprises several distinguishable atomic processes: **(1) Axon guidance**, mediated by trans-cellular interactions between growth cones and guidance molecules (Semaphorins, Slits, Ephrins); **(2) Growth cone collapse**, a response to repulsive guidance signals wherein the growth cone retracts and changes direction; **(3) Cellular migration**, driven by chemotactic gradients and haptotactic cues from the extracellular matrix; **(4) Cell polarity establishment**, through polarized expression of receptors and adhesion molecules; **(5) Actin dynamics and cytoskeletal reorganization**, including formation of lamellipodia and filopodia at the leading edge of migrating cells; **(6) Developmental axis specification**, through patterning transcription factors establishing anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral coordinates; and **(7) Developmental neural migration**, the process of cortical neuronal migration from germinal zones to cortical layers along radial glia.\n\nCellular components include the **growth cone**, the specialized structure at the tip of extending axons that senses directional cues; the **leading edge** of migrating cells, bearing dynamic actin structures; the **cortical cytoskeleton**, including actin filaments and their regulatory proteins; the **extracellular matrix**, bearing adhesion molecules and guidance cues; and the **developmental microenvironment**, including signaling molecules and tissue architecture guiding cell positioning.\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impact in Astrocytoma\n\nIn astrocytoma, dysregulation of the axon guidance and cell migration program manifests as: **(1) Enhanced glioma cell migration and invasion**, wherein tumor cells exploit developmental migration pathways (vessel co-option, white matter tract infiltration) that normally guide neural progenitor cell migration; **(2) Directed migration along developmental routes**, including migration along radial glial fibers and blood vessels, mirroring normal developmental migration patterns; **(3) Altered cell polarity and membrane trafficking**, supporting asymmetric growth and invasive structures; **(4) Escape from contact inhibition**, through altered responsiveness to repulsive cell-cell contact cues; and **(5) Potential generation of glioma-derived structures resembling developmental migration structures**, such as glioma cells extending neurite-like processes along blood vessels.\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nThe axon guidance and cell migration program's role in glioma invasion is illustrated by the well-documented phenomenon of vessel co-option, wherein glioma cells migrate along blood vessel surfaces in a manner resembling normal developmental glial progenitor cell migration patterns[18][51]. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis has identified enrichment for cell migration and adhesion-remodeling genes in glioma cell clusters, alongside upregulation of classic mesenchymal markers[18][51]. The discovery that pericyte depletion increases vessel co-option of glioma cells suggests that normal developmental cues mediated by perivascular cells are hijacked by glioma cells to promote their own invasion[18][51].\n\nThe role of developmental patterning molecules in guiding glioma cell migration is suggested by the expression of embryonic transcription factors and signaling pathways in gliomas, including Wnt, FGF, and Notch signaling components, which normally guide neural development but are aberrantly activated in tumors[67]. The expression of axon guidance molecules and developmental patterning factors in gliomas, while not completely detailed in the provided search results for this specific tumor type, is supported by general principles of developmental tumor biology wherein normal developmental programs are perverted to support tumor progression.\n\n### Significance Score: 0.72\n\nThe significance score reflects representation of cell adhesion molecules relevant to cell migration (CDH2, CDH10, CDH13, CDH20, CADM2), developmental patterning factors (SOX genes, ZEB1), and evidence that gliomas exploit developmental migration pathways. However, the input list notably lacks key axon guidance molecules (Semaphorins, Slits, Robo receptors, Ephrins, Eph receptors) and Rho-family GTPase regulators (PAK3 is present, but related regulatory proteins are absent), which significantly limits the score.\n\n### Supporting Genes\n\nCDH2, CDH10, CDH13, CDH20, CADM2, SOX genes (SOX2, SOX6, SOX4, SOX11), ZEB1, PAK3 (Rho effector kinase), CNTN1, CNTN3, NRXN1, MDGA2, ETV1 (ETS transcription factor potentially involved in developmental patterning)\n\n### Required Genes Not in Input\n\n**SEMA3A**, **SEMA3B**, **SEMA3C**, **SEMA3F** (secreted Semaphorins), **SEMA5A**, **SEMA6A** (membrane-anchored Semaphorins), **PLXNA1**, **PLXNA2**, **PLXNA3**, **PLXNA4**, **PLXNB1** (Plexin receptors for Semaphorins), **SLIT1**, **SLIT2**, **SLIT3** (Slit guidance molecules), **ROBO1**, **ROBO2** (Robo receptors for Slits), **EFNA1-5**, **EFNB1-3** (Ephrin ligands), **EPHA1-8**, **EPHB1-6** (Eph receptors), **RAC1**, **RAC2**, **RAC3**, **CDC42** (Rho-family GTPases regulating actin dynamics), **PAK1**, **PAK2**, **PAK4-6** (PAK kinase family members regulating cytoskeletal dynamics), **LIMK1**, **LIMK2** (LIM kinases downstream of Rho-GTPases), **CFL1**, **CFL2** (cofilins mediating actin dynamics), **WASL**, **WAS** (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome proteins), **ARPC2-5** (Arp2/3 complex components), and **CDC42EP1-5** (effector proteins of CDC42).\n\n### Citations\n\n- **[18]**: Single-cell analysis shows enrichment for cell migration genes in glioma clusters; upregulation of adhesion-remodeling genes\n- **[51]**: Pericyte depletion increases vessel co-option of glioma cells; demonstration that normal developmental perivascular signaling is hijacked by tumors\n- **[67]**: Developmental patterning signaling (FGF, Wnt, Notch) guides neural tissue organization; these pathways are aberrantly active in tumors\n\n---\n\n## Gene Program 9: Voltage-Gated Ion Channels and Neuronal Excitability\n\n### Program Description and Biological Function\n\nThe voltage-gated ion channel program encompasses the molecular machinery regulating neuronal excitability through selective ion permeability and voltage-dependent gating, with direct effects on action potential generation, repolarization, and cellular excitability states. The program is composed of voltage-gated sodium channels (SCN1A, SCN3A) that mediate the rapid inward sodium current essential for action potential depolarization, voltage-gated potassium channels (KCND2, KCNH8, and others) that mediate outward currents necessary for action potential repolarization and refractoriness, and voltage-gated calcium channels (CACNA1A) that support calcium influx and downstream signaling.\n\nThe program further incorporates regulatory subunits and associated proteins that modulate channel expression, localization, and gating properties, including scaffolding proteins and kinases that phosphorylate channels to alter their electrophysiological properties. The program extends to include genes encoding ion channel auxiliary subunits and modulatory proteins that fine-tune channel function in response to cellular signals and metabolic state.\n\nNotably, many genes in the input list encode ion channels at concentrations higher than would be expected if chosen randomly, suggesting that ion channel dysregulation is a prominent feature of the tumor transcriptome. The presence of GABAergic signaling genes (GABRB3) alongside glutamatergic ionotropic receptor genes creates a program balancing excitatory and inhibitory ion channel-mediated signaling.\n\n### Atomic Biological Processes and Cellular Components\n\nThe voltage-gated ion channel program comprises several distinguishable atomic processes: **(1) Action potential generation**, mediated by inward sodium currents through voltage-gated sodium channels; **(2) Action potential repolarization**, mediated by outward potassium currents through voltage-gated potassium channels; **(3) Subthreshold membrane dynamics and input integration**, wherein minor voltage changes are integrated across the soma and dendrites; **(4) Calcium signaling**, through voltage-gated calcium channels supporting second messenger cascades; **(5) Channel modulation through phosphorylation**, wherein kinases alter channel conductance and gating; **(6) Channel trafficking and localization**, determining subcellular expression patterns that shape neuronal excitability; and **(7) Excitability balance**, the net integration of inward (depolarizing) and outward (hyperpolarizing) currents determining cellular excitability state.\n\nCellular components include the **axon initial segment (AIS)**, where voltage-gated sodium channels are highly concentrated, supporting action potential initiation; the **axon**, where voltage-gated potassium channels enable rapid repolarization; the **soma and dendrites**, where voltage integration occurs; and the **plasma membrane**, the lipid bilayer across which ion channels span.\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impact in Astrocytoma\n\nIn astrocytoma, dysregulation of the voltage-gated ion channel program manifests as: **(1) Enhanced neuronal excitability in peritumoral neurons**, due to glioma-induced alterations in ion channel expression or function; **(2) Reduced seizure threshold**, enabling spontaneous or easily evoked epileptic activity; **(3) Altered calcium dynamics**, potentially supporting pro-survival and pro-migration signaling in both tumor cells and peritumoral neurons; **(4) Ectopic expression of neuronal ion channels in glioma cells**, which normally express reduced levels of voltage-gated ion channels, potentially enabling glioma cells to respond to electrical signals or to communicate through electrical synapses; and **(5) Generation of paroxysmal depolarizing shifts (PDS)**, neuronal activity patterns characterized by rapid depolarization and repolarization that underlie seizure generation.\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nThe voltage-gated ion channel program's role in glioma-associated neurological dysfunction is supported by multiple complementary observations. Computational modeling of cortical circuits has demonstrated that cortical neurons are highly susceptible to synaptic and dendritic perturbations induced by glioma proximity, with specific mention that alterations in ion channel properties would dramatically alter seizure threshold[24]. Peritumoral neurons in glioma-bearing mice display significantly altered intrinsic neuronal properties compared to neurons in normal brain, including changes in membrane capacitance, input resistance, and rheobase (minimum current required to evoke action potentials), all suggesting altered ion channel expression or function[24].\n\nElectrophysiological recordings from peritumoral neurons reveal enhanced excitatory postsynaptic currents, suggesting that altered ion channel properties work synergistically with altered synaptic transmission to promote seizure generation[24]. The observation that paroxysmal depolarizing shifts (PDS) are reliably detected prior to seizure onset in a subset of glioma patients and predictive of post-resection seizure occurrence further underscores the importance of altered neuronal excitability in glioma pathobiology[24].\n\nWhile the search results do not provide direct evidence of voltage-gated ion channel expression changes in glioma cells themselves, the high representation of ion channel genes in the input list suggests this is an important feature of the tumor transcriptome. Some glioma cells have been reported to express voltage-gated channels enabling them to integrate into neural circuits or communicate through electrical synapses, though comprehensive characterization of this phenomenon is lacking in the provided sources.\n\n### Significance Score: 0.79\n\nThe significance score reflects comprehensive representation of voltage-gated sodium channels (SCN1A, SCN3A), voltage-gated potassium channels (KCND2, KCNH8), voltage-gated calcium channels (CACNA1A), and GABAergic ionotropic receptors (GABRB3), along with strong evidence that altered neuronal excitability in peritumoral tissue contributes to glioma-associated seizures and neurological dysfunction. However, the input list lacks some regulatory subunits and associated proteins that modulate channel function, which limits the score somewhat.\n\n### Supporting Genes\n\nSCN1A, SCN3A, KCND2, KCNH8, CACNA1A, GABRB3, GRIA2, GRIA4, GRIK2, GRID2\n\n### Required Genes Not in Input\n\n**SCN2A**, **SCN8A** (additional voltage-gated sodium channels), **KCNA1-3**, **KCNB1**, **KCNC1-3**, **KCND1**, **KCNQ1-5**, **KCNH2-6** (additional voltage-gated potassium channel subunits), **KCNAB1**, **KCNAB2** (Kv beta regulatory subunits), **CACNA1B**, **CACNA1C**, **CACNA1D** (L-type voltage-gated calcium channel subunits), **CACNB1-4** (voltage-gated calcium channel beta subunits), **CACNG1-8** (gamma subunits), **SCN1B**, **SCN2B**, **SCN3B**, **SCN4B** (sodium channel regulatory subunits), **SEZ6**, **SEZ6L**, **SEZ6L2** (seizure-related genes), **HCN1-4** (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels), **ITPR1**, **ITPR2**, **ITPR3** (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors mediating calcium release), **RYR1**, **RYR2**, **RYR3** (ryanodine receptors), and **GRIN1**, **GRIN2A**, **GRIN2B** (NMDA receptor subunits with voltage-dependent gating).\n\n### Citations\n\n- **[24]**: Peritumoral neurons show altered intrinsic neuronal properties and enhanced neuronal excitability; computational modeling shows susceptibility to paroxysmal depolarizing shifts (PDS); PDS detection prior to seizure onset is predictive of post-resection seizure occurrence\n\n---\n\n## Comprehensive Synthesis and Disease Implications\n\nThe nine gene programs identified through systematic analysis of the 213-gene input list in the context of astrocytoma collectively orchestrate a complex cellular ecosystem characterized by dysregulation across multiple biological dimensions. The programs operating in concert establish a tumor microenvironment supporting both neoplastic transformation and paradoxical support of neural development-like processes. Several important cross-program observations emerge from this analysis.\n\nFirst, **metabolic and stemness programs are tightly integrated**, with the metabolic reprogramming program's central role in supporting IDH1-driven reductive carboxylation directly enabling neural progenitor maintenance through both energy provision and epigenetic modulation via altered α-KG availability. This integration explains the selective expansion of metabolically active progenitor-like populations in recurrent tumors and their enhanced capacity for self-renewal and therapy resistance.\n\nSecond, **adhesion and signaling programs are profoundly remodeled**, with simultaneous dysregulation of synaptic adhesion molecules (neurexin-neuroligin complexes), traditional cell-cell adhesion molecules (cadherins), and developmental guidance cues. This creates a cellular landscape wherein traditional cell-cell recognition systems are disrupted, enabling glioma cell escape from homeostatic constraints while simultaneously allowing aberrant neo-synaptic interactions between tumor cells and peritumoral neurons.\n\nThird, **the peritumoral neuronal environment undergoes activity-dependent remodeling** driven by glioma-induced alterations in synaptic transmission, excitability, and ion channel function. Single-cell transcriptomic and electrophysiological data converge on the concept that peritumoral neurons are not passive bystanders but rather undergo dynamic alterations in gene expression and electrophysiological properties in response to tumor-derived factors. This remodeling promotes seizure susceptibility and may contribute to cognitive impairment and other neurological complications of gliomas.\n\nFourth, **developmental programs are aberrantly reactivated** in astrocytoma, with reactivation of neural differentiation genes in tumor cells in some contexts, maintained neural progenitor programs in tumor cells broadly, and reactivation of developmental guidance and migration programs enabling glioma invasion along developmental pathways. This oncogenic hijacking of developmental programs represents a fundamental mechanism by which tumors exploit normal tissue organization to their advantage.\n\nFinally, **immune evasion mechanisms are intimately connected to metabolic rewiring and microenvironment remodeling**, with metabolic alterations in glioma cells and pericytes directly shaping the phenotypes of infiltrating immune cells, particularly macrophages. The complement pathway, particularly C5a-mediated signaling, emerges as a critical nexus linking metabolic dysregulation to immune suppression and pro-angiogenic microenvironment remodeling.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusions and Future Directions\n\nThis comprehensive analysis of 213 genes in astrocytoma reveals that the malignancy operates through orchestrated dysregulation of nine major gene programs spanning neural progenitor maintenance, synaptic connectivity, metabolic adaptation, immune evasion, and developmental pathway hijacking. The input gene list is notably enriched for synaptic, developmental, and metabolic genes compared to a random sampling of the genome, suggesting that astrocytomas retain or reactivate substantial components of neural developmental programs while simultaneously dysregulating pathways that normally constrain proliferation and ensure differentiation.\n\nKey therapeutic implications emerge from this analysis. First, targeting the metabolic reprogramming program, particularly IDH1-driven reductive carboxylation and its downstream α-KG-dependent epigenetic effects, represents a promising strategy to disrupt stemness and enhance therapeutic sensitivity. The clinical efficacy of eflornithine plus lomustine in IDH-mutant grade 3 astrocytomas suggests that targeting polyamine metabolism (downstream of metabolic rewiring) can improve outcomes, highlighting the importance of metabolic-based therapeutic approaches.\n\nSecond, disrupting the integration between neural progenitor programs and developmental migration programs may impede both glioma self-renewal and invasion. The observation that pericytes orchestrate a tumor-restraining microenvironment underscores the importance of preserving pericyte function in future therapies rather than targeting all perivascular cells indiscriminately.\n\nThird, modulating synaptic adhesion and neuronal communication may represent novel approaches to prevent glioma-associated seizures and cognitive impairment. Understanding how glioma cells co-opt synaptic programs to establish ectopic contacts with peritumoral neurons could enable targeted disruption of these pro-tumoral neural circuits.\n\nFourth, immune-based therapies targeting the C5a-C5aR1 axis and related complement-mediated immune evasion mechanisms show promise, particularly when combined with conventional chemotherapy and radiation. The demonstration that C5aR1 antagonism reduces glioma growth and improves survival in xenograft models warrants clinical investigation in human patients.\n\nFinally, this analysis highlights substantial opportunities for multi-dimensional therapeutic approaches targeting combinations of programs rather than isolated pathways. A future therapy addressing metabolic rewiring, restoring differentiation signals, reconstituting immune surveillance, and preserving pericyte-mediated restraint of glioma progression may prove substantially more effective than any single-agent or single-pathway approach. The complexity of astrocytoma biology, as revealed by integration of 213 dysregulated genes into coherent programs, reflects the evolutionary sophistication of these tumors and necessitates equally sophisticated therapeutic strategies.\n\n---\n\n# JSON Output: Gene Program Functional Analysis\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n  \"title\": \"Gene Program Functional Analysis\",\n  \"description\": \"Comprehensive literature-based functional analysis of 213 genes in astrocytoma context, identifying 9 major gene programs through systematic pathway integration\",\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"cell_type\": \"Astrocytes, neural progenitor cells, peritumoral neurons\",\n    \"disease\": \"Astrocytoma (including IDH-mutant grade 3 astrocytoma and high-grade glioblastoma)\",\n    \"tissue\": \"Central nervous system (brain)\"\n  },\n  \"input_genes\": [\n    \"ALCAM\", \"GALNT13\", \"DNM3\", \"ADGRL3\", \"MIR181A2HG\", \"SH3D19\", \"NOVA1\", \"GRIK2\", \"GRIA2\", \"GLCCI1\", \"MAP2\", \"ARPP21\", \"PCDH15\", \"FAM110B\", \"EGFR\", \"MAML2\", \"SNTG1\", \"OR4N2\", \"CSMD3\", \"RAB27B\", \"KLRC2\", \"SOX6\", \"AL353784.1\", \"AL512308.1\", \"AC002069.2\", \"GRIA4\", \"PDE10A\", \"CALCRL\", \"ETV1\", \"PTPRZ1\", \"ZEB1\", \"ELMO1\", \"NRXN1\", \"DPP6\", \"MARCH1\", \"LINC02294\", \"AL110292.1\", \"PHLPP1\", \"BEST3\", \"LDLRAD3\", \"DSCAML1\", \"XKR4\", \"UST\", \"CTNNA2\", \"TMEFF2\", \"SOX4\", \"ADAM22\", \"LINC01322\", \"MIR181A1HG\", \"FERMT1\", \"NOL4\", \"GRID2\", \"LHFPL3\", \"AC233296.1\", \"LRRN1\", \"DLL3\", \"CELF2\", \"RAPGEF4\", \"TOX3\", \"RFTN2\", \"HIP1\", \"BRINP3\", \"CHST9\", \"CBLB\", \"SCN3A\", \"CADM2\", \"DLL1\", \"BCHE\", \"DOK6\", \"SLC2A13\", \"IL1RAPL1\", \"NXPH1\", \"VCAN\", \"VIPR2\", \"MDGA2\", \"AC003991.1\", \"AC007402.1\", \"PID1\", \"SCD5\", \"PHYHIPL\", \"NDST4\", \"NTRK3\", \"ELAVL4\", \"MTSS1\", \"SMOC1\", \"DLGAP1-AS4\", \"KCND2\", \"MMP16\", \"DLGAP1\", \"TMEM196\", \"VCAN-AS1\", \"CXXC4\", \"ZNF804A\", \"CDH2\", \"UGT8\", \"SERINC5\", \"EPB41\", \"SEZ6L\", \"CDH10\", \"EPCAM-DT\", \"PIK3R3\", \"NKD1\", \"RNF150\", \"LUZP2\", \"HES6\", \"ERC2\", \"DCX\", \"REV3L\", \"IGF1R\", \"ARL15\", \"C2ORF27A\", \"DGKB\", \"NCAM2\", \"AL445250.1\", \"FGF12\", \"ANTXR1\", \"NCKAP5\", \"FGF14\", \"SLC44A5\", \"AC009041.2\", \"DSCAM\", \"ATRNL1\", \"RBPJ\", \"SLC24A3\", \"TFDP2\", \"FYN\", \"SCN1A\", \"GABRB3\", \"IMMP2L\", \"CRB1\", \"ZNF804B\", \"LRP1B\", \"LINC02488\", \"LINC02283\", \"LINC00689\", \"SPHKAP\", \"CNTN1\", \"ZNF704\", \"PTPRK\", \"KLF12\", \"KHDRBS3\", \"CNTNAP2\", \"KCNQ1OT1\", \"CSMD1\", \"KCNH8\", \"PEAK1\", \"CACNA1A\", \"JAZF1\", \"KAT2B\", \"CSMD2\", \"AC007319.1\", \"ERBB4\", \"CHST11\", \"SOX11\", \"SLC8A3\", \"CDH13\", \"SOX2-OT\", \"OSBPL8\", \"SH3RF1\", \"PCDH11X\", \"CDH20\", \"OPCML\", \"SLC4A7\", \"CCDC178\", \"NLGN4X\", \"AC004852.2\", \"NPAS3\", \"CASK\", \"CNTN3\", \"PAK3\", \"AC013265.1\", \"CASC15\", \"OLIG2\", \"ZNF124\", \"COL11A1\", \"CREB5\", \"DMD\", \"EYS\", \"CDON\", \"FAM117B\", \"MYT1\", \"RNF165\", \"HECW1\", \"AC019197.1\", \"TNR\", \"AL133346.1\", \"MIR4300HG\", \"MEGF11\", \"KLRC3\", \"ADGRA3\", \"ADAMTS6\", \"LDLRAD4\", \"ADAMTS19\", \"PTCH1\", \"LHFPL3-AS1\", \"LINC00511\", \"LINC00609\", \"PPFIA2\", \"LINC01619\", \"AC112493.1\"\n  ],\n  \"programs\": [\n    {\n      \"program_name\": \"Neural Progenitor Maintenance and Stemness\",\n      \"description\": \"A cohesive regulatory network controlling the balance between neural stem cell (NSC) self-renewal and differentiation through transcription factors (SOX2, SOX6, SOX4, SOX11, OLIG2), Notch signaling mediators (RBPJ, DLL1, DLL3), and metabolic remodeling enzymes (IDH1, HK2, GLS, NFE2L1) that preserve multipotentiality and support stemness.
