Through clustering genes into functionally coherent programs, we identify critical biological processes disrupted in astrocytic malignancy, including synaptic remodeling, developmental plasticity, glial differentiation, metabolic reprogramming, and immune-glial crosstalk. Our analysis reveals that many candidate genes participate in overlapping pathways controlling neural development and cellular homeostasis, with dysregulation of these programs contributing to astrocytoma pathogenesis and progression. By integrating evidence from recent transcriptomic studies of gliomas and genetically engineered models, we provide a framework for understanding how developmental gene programs become corrupted in malignant transformation.\n\n## Astrocytoma: Molecular Subtypes and Cellular Context\n\nAstrocytomas represent a heterogeneous class of central nervous system tumors arising from astrocytic lineage cells or astrocytic progenitors. Modern molecular classification systems, such as the 2021 WHO Classification of CNS Tumors, have fundamentally reshaped our understanding of these malignancies by demonstrating that isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status and TP53 alterations constitute core defining features[2]. IDH-mutant astrocytomas, typically occurring in younger patients, demonstrate significantly improved prognosis compared to IDH wildtype glioblastomas, with median progression-free survival reaching 61 months and overall survival exceeding 102 months in IDH-mutant forms compared to 12 and 24 months respectively in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas[2]. These molecular distinctions are not merely prognostic but reflect fundamentally different cellular states and response patterns. Recent mechanistic studies have demonstrated that glioblastoma progression involves sequential acquisition of mutations that promote functional plasticity through interplay between cell-intrinsic genetic alterations and developmental programs[24]. In particular, triple mutant models incorporating TERT promoter mutations, TP53 loss, and PDGFRA alterations reliably generate lethal tumors and exhibit transition toward neuronal progenitor-like states driven by transcription factors such as INSM1[24]. This developmental context is critical for interpreting the functional roles of genes in the analyzed list, as many participate in programs controlling neural differentiation, progenitor maintenance, and lineage specification that become aberrantly activated or suppressed during malignant transformation.\n\n## Gene Program 1: Synaptic Adhesion and Plasticity-Related Functions\n\nThe first major gene program identified encompasses genes regulating synaptic structure, neuronal-glial communication, and activity-dependent plasticity mechanisms. This program includes MAP2, CADM2, TNR, LRRTM4, NRCAM, ALCAM, CNTN3, NCAM2, CTNNA3, AJAP1, PCDH15, and CDH13. These genes encode cell adhesion molecules, synaptic scaffolding proteins, and extracellular matrix components essential for normal synapse formation, maintenance, and plasticity. MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2) represents one of the most abundant dendritic cytoskeletal proteins and serves as a canonical marker for neuronal differentiation and dendrite stability[11]. CADM2 (cell adhesion molecule 2), also known as SynCAM2, mediates homophilic cell adhesion and plays well-established roles in presynaptic terminal formation and synaptic organization[9]. TNR (tenascin R) functions as an extracellular matrix component that modulates synaptic plasticity and information storage within neural circuits[44].\n\nThe functional significance of this program in astrocytoma becomes apparent when considering that peritumoral astrocytes exhibit profound alterations in gene expression patterns related to synaptic function and cellular communication. Recent analyses of chronic traumatic brain injury revealed marked downregulation of genes associated with synaptic and cellular communication, including transcripts encoding NRCAM (neuron-glia CAM), KIRREL3 (immunoglobulin superfamily receptor), and other adhesion molecules in reactive astrocytes[23][29]. In the tumor context, aberrant expression of synaptic adhesion molecules may reflect either reactive astrocyte responses to peritumoral neurons or, alternatively, plasticity mechanisms whereby tumor-derived cells acquire synaptic properties. Notably, the gene list includes multiple protocadherin and cadherin family members (PCDH15, CDH13, CTNNA3) that regulate cell-cell communication through calcium-dependent adhesion mechanisms. PCDH15 mutations cause Usher syndrome, a syndromic form of retinal and auditory neurodegeneration characterized by disrupted adhesion-dependent cell survival[52]. In astrocytoma, altered expression of these adhesion molecules could compromise normal neuron-glia interactions and contribute to peritumoral seizure susceptibility through disrupted synaptic stabilization.\n\nSeveral genes in this program participate in establishing proper dendrite development and morphology. LRRTM4 (leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal protein 4) functions as a postsynaptic adhesion molecule that recruits presynaptic terminals and regulates excitatory synapse strength. AJAP1 (adherens junction-associated protein 1) couples cell adhesion to cytoskeletal organization through interactions with catenins and actin regulators. The presence of multiple components of the adherens junction machinery (CTNNA3, potentially interacting with cadherins) suggests coordinated dysregulation of cell-cell junctions in astrocytoma. This is particularly relevant given that reactive astrocytes undergo significant morphological changes and reorganization of junctional proteins during injury responses[23][29]. ALCAM (activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule) represents an immunoglobulin superfamily member expressed in neural development and implicated in leukocyte migration and glial-immune interactions[8]. In the tumor microenvironment, altered ALCAM expression could influence both immune infiltration and glial-immune crosstalk.\n\nThe convergent downregulation of synaptic communication and adhesion genes in reactive astrocytes, documented in multiple CNS pathologies, suggests that astrocytoma cells may recapitulate similar transcriptional programs. However, unlike the transient nature of injury-induced astrocyte reactivity, tumor-associated astrocyte dysfunction may represent a more stable, maladaptive state. The presence of genes controlling both presynaptic and postsynaptic structures, along with extracellular matrix components, indicates this program integrates multiple levels of synaptic organization. Supporting this interpretation, studies of glioma-induced seizures have revealed that peritumoral neurons exhibit significant transcriptional alterations in genes controlling synaptic transmission and plasticity[32]. These alterations correlate with increased excitatory postsynaptic current amplitudes and susceptibility to seizures[32].\n\n## Gene Program 2: Glutamatergic Signaling and Excitatory Neurotransmission\n\nA second major program encompasses genes regulating excitatory glutamatergic transmission, including GRIA2, GRIA3, GRIA4 (AMPA and kainate receptor subunits), SLC1A1 (astrocytic glutamate transporter EAAT3), and potentially GRID2 (glutamate ionotropic receptor delta type 2). These genes represent components of the glutamate synapse from multiple functional perspectives: ion channels permeable to glutamate, transporters that recycle glutamate, and modulatory components. The biological importance of this program emerges from the well-established role of excess extracellular glutamate in tumor-associated seizures and peritumoral neuronal hyperexcitability[32]. Recent studies using inducible glioma models demonstrate that glioma cells cause elevation of local glutamate concentration through transporter dysfunction and direct glutamate release, triggering neuronal hyperexcitability and paroxysmal depolarizing shifts characteristic of seizure initiation[32].\n\nGRIA2 encodes the GluA2 subunit of AMPA receptors, which is critical for determining calcium permeability and long-term potentiation properties of excitatory synapses. Notably, GRIA2 expression in peritumoral neurons has been examined in glioma-associated seizure models, revealing significant dysregulation of AMPA receptor composition in neurons adjacent to tumors[32]. The presence of GRIA3 and GRIA4, encoding alternative AMPA receptor subunits, suggests coordinated changes in glutamate receptor stoichiometry during malignant transformation. SLC1A1 encodes EAAT3, one of the primary glutamate transporters in neurons, responsible for recycling glutamate from synaptic clefts. While astrocytes express EAAT1 and EAAT2 (SLC1A2), neuronal EAAT3 represents an important source of glutamate homeostasis in the synaptic microenvironment. Dysregulation of neuronal glutamate transporters could impair glutamate clearance and contribute to excitotoxicity[32].\n\nGRID2 encodes the glutamate receptor delta-2 subunit, primarily expressed in cerebellum but with potential roles in other neural circuits. Delta receptors show lower calcium permeability than traditional ionotropic receptors and may participate in synaptic plasticity and developmental synapse elimination. The inclusion of GRID2 alongside canonical glutamate receptor subunits suggests the input gene list may encompass both canonical excitatory signaling components and modulatory glutamate-binding proteins.\n\nThe convergence of glutamatergic components with ion channel genes (discussed in the following section) implies that astrocytoma-associated transcriptional programs dysregulate multiple levels of excitatory synaptic transmission. This is consistent with the observation that peritumoral neurons in glioma models exhibit not only altered glutamate receptor expression but also changes in intrinsic excitability properties controlled by voltage-gated ion channels[32]. The functional consequence of coordinated dysregulation of this program would include enhanced susceptibility to seizures through reduced glutamate clearance, altered postsynaptic sensitivity to glutamate, and increased intrinsic neuronal excitability.\n\n## Gene Program 3: Voltage-Gated Ion Channels and Neuronal Excitability\n\nA third major gene program encompasses voltage-gated sodium channels (SCN1A, SCN3A), ATP-gated purinergic receptors (P2RX7), acid-sensing ion channels (ASIC4), and potassium channel interacting proteins (KCNIP4). These genes collectively control the rapid depolarization-repolarization cycles and intrinsic excitability properties of neurons. SCN1A and SCN3A encode voltage-gated sodium channel alpha subunits that generate the rapid inward sodium current critical for action potential initiation and propagation. Mutations in SCN1A cause genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), directly implicating SCN1A in seizure susceptibility[34]. SCN3A mutations have similarly been associated with epilepsy in patient cohorts, suggesting sodium channel dysfunction contributes to neuronal hyperexcitability[37].\n\nP2RX7 encodes a ligand-gated cation channel activated by extracellular ATP, expressed in both neuronal and glial cells. In microglia and immune cells, P2RX7 activation triggers inflammatory responses and cell lysis[38]. In neurons, P2RX7 can mediate excitatory signaling and calcium influx. The presence of P2RX7 in the gene list suggests potential dysregulation of ATP-dependent excitatory signaling in astrocytoma, relevant given that tumor and immune cells release ATP during stress and inflammation. ASIC4 (acid-sensing ion channel 4) represents an amiloride-sensitive cation channel activated by extracellular acidification. In the tumor microenvironment, local acidification occurs due to glycolytic activity and lactate accumulation[54], potentially activating ASIC channels and contributing to neuronal excitability.\n\nKCNIP4 encodes a potassium channel interacting protein belonging to the KCHIP family. These proteins modulate potassium channel expression, localization, and functional properties, thereby controlling neuronal repolarization and firing frequency. Dysregulation of potassium channel function through altered KCNIP expression could shift neurons toward a more excitable state by reducing hyperpolarization-activated currents.\n\nThe convergence of sodium, potassium, and ATP-gated channels in this program reflects multiple mechanisms through which intrinsic neuronal excitability can be enhanced in the peritumoral environment. Notably, astrocytoma-associated seizures emerge through not only synaptic mechanisms (excess glutamate, altered glutamate receptor expression) but also through altered intrinsic properties of peritumoral neurons, directly implicating voltage-gated channel dysregulation[32]. Recent patch-clamp electrophysiology studies confirm that peritumoral neurons in glioma models exhibit higher intrinsic excitability and increased spontaneous firing rates compared to distant neurons[32]. This enhancement correlates with transcriptional alterations in genes controlling ion channel properties and excitability, consistent with dysregulation of Program 3.\n\n## Gene Program 4: Oligodendrocyte Lineage Development and Myelination\n\nA fourth major program encompasses genes essential for oligodendrocyte specification, differentiation, and myelin formation, including SOX10, SOX8, SOX5, SOX6, OLIG1, RBPJ, ALCAM, UGT8, BCAS1, and MBEP11. These genes represent multiple levels of oligodendrocyte development from transcriptional regulation to myelin protein expression. SOX10 encodes a transcription factor essential for oligodendrocyte specification and myelination[10]. During CNS development, SOX10 is expressed in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and mature oligodendrocytes, where it activates lineage-specific genes controlling myelin formation. SOX8 and SOX5 represent related SOX family transcription factors with overlapping and distinct functions in glial development. SOX family members frequently cooperate with other transcription factors to establish and maintain lineage identity.\n\nOLIG1 and SOX10 act synergistically in promoting oligodendrocyte differentiation. Indeed, the canonical oligodendrocyte developmental pathway involves sequential activity of multiple SOX and bHLH transcription factors (OLIG2, OLIG1, SOX10) that together establish the oligodendrocyte-specific transcriptional program[22]. RBPJ (recombining binding protein suppressor of hairless) functions as a key effector of Notch signaling, which is critical for maintaining OPC progenitor status and preventing premature differentiation. During development, active Notch signaling through RBPJ suppresses oligodendrocyte differentiation, whereas Notch inhibition promotes maturation[20].\n\nUGT8 encodes the enzyme ceramide galactosyltransferase, essential for synthesis of galactocerebroside, the major lipid component of myelin. BCAS1 (breast carcinoma amplified sequence 1) and MBEP11 represent components of the myelin-forming machinery, with their expression tightly coupled to the onset of myelination. The convergence of transcriptional regulators (SOX, OLIG, RBPJ), adhesion molecules (ALCAM), and structural/enzymatic components (UGT8, BCAS1) indicates coordinated dysregulation of oligodendrocyte development in astrocytoma.\n\nThe relevance of this program to astrocytoma pathogenesis emerges from multiple observations. First, adult high-grade gliomas arise in a neural microenvironment populated by mature oligodendrocytes and their progenitors. Glioma cells can interact with OPCs through paracrine signaling, influencing their differentiation and recruitment. Second, recent studies of injury-induced glial responses reveal that OPCs undergo substantial transcriptional reprogramming following CNS injury, with altered expression of developmental transcription factors[10]. In the tumor context, similar dysregulation of oligodendrocyte developmental pathways may occur, either through direct paracrine effects of tumor cells or through altered inflammatory signaling affecting the OPC niche.\n\nThird, and importantly, astrocytomas themselves can exhibit cellular plasticity encompassing partial adoption of oligodendrocyte or progenitor-like gene expression patterns[24]. The presence of oligodendrocyte lineage genes in the input list suggests that astrocytoma samples analyzed in the source study may represent tumors with multilineage gene expression or tumors arising in oligodendrocyte-enriched regions. Indeed, molecular classification of diffuse gliomas has revealed subsets of tumors with intermediate or mixed differentiation states[2][5]. The functional implications of dysregulation of Program 4 include potential conversion of OPCs to alternative cell fates (including transformation to tumor cells), impaired myelin maintenance in peritumoral regions (contributing to neuronal dysfunction), and altered oligodendrocyte-derived paracrine signaling affecting tumor microenvironment composition.\n\n## Gene Program 5: Fibroblast Growth Factor Signaling and Developmental Patterning\n\nA fifth gene program encompasses FGF ligands and their signaling components (FGF12, FGF14), along with morphogenic signaling pathways controlling developmental patterning. FGF12 and FGF14 encode fibroblast growth factors with distinct developmental roles. FGF signaling represents one of the most fundamental pathways controlling neural development, regulating neural progenitor proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival. FGF12 and FGF14 represent members of the intracellular FGF subfamily (also called iFGFs or FGF homologous factors), which function as intracellular modulators of FGF receptor signaling and ion channel properties rather than secreted ligands[1].\n\nThe inclusion of FGF12 and FGF14 in the gene list suggests dysregulation of intracellular FGF signaling and ion channel modulation in astrocytoma. These proteins interact with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) and voltage-gated calcium channels to modulate neuronal excitability and signaling dynamics. In the context of gliomas, FGF signaling dysregulation through overexpression of FGFR or ligands contributes to malignant progression in specific tumor subtypes. The convergence of FGF components with other morphogenic pathways in the gene list suggests coordinated alterations in developmental signaling.\n\nRelated to morphogenic patterning, the gene list includes components of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway. While canonical Shh pathway genes (SHH, PTCH1, GLI genes) are not all represented, PTCH1 (patched homolog 1), the receptor for Shh ligand, appears in the list. Shh signaling plays critical roles in CNS development, controlling midline patterning, ventral neural tube specification, and cerebellar development. In adult tissues, Shh signaling can be reactivated in disease states. Notably, Shh pathway hyperactivation drives medulloblastoma, a pediatric brain tumor with frequent Shh pathway mutations. While less common in astrocytomas, occasional PTCH1 or SMO mutations occur in gliomas, and Shh pathway dysregulation has been documented in subsets of adult high-grade gliomas.\n\nThe functional significance of Program 5 (FGF and morphogenic signaling) in astrocytoma relates to its role in neural progenitor maintenance and differentiation. Dysregulation of these pathways can promote uncontrolled progenitor proliferation, impair differentiation, and enhance cellular plasticity. Recent studies demonstrate that glioblastoma tumors exhibit plasticity driven by developmental programs, including neuronal progenitor-like and intermediate progenitor-like states[24]. Transcription factors controlling developmental patterning, such as INSM1, become upregulated during glioblastoma progression and drive oncogenic gene expression[24]. The presence of morphogenic pathway components in the gene list suggests that astrocytoma-associated transcriptional programs dysregulate fundamental developmental signaling networks.\n\n## Gene Program 6: Growth Factor Receptors and Tyrosine Kinase Signaling\n\nA sixth major program encompasses growth factor receptors and their signaling effectors, including PDGFRA (platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha), ERBB3, ERBB4 (ErbB3 and ErbB4, neuregulin receptors), and downstream effectors such as FYN (a Src family tyrosine kinase). PDGFRA represents one of the canonical oncogenic drivers in glioblastoma and related gliomas. PDGFRA mutations or copy number amplifications occur in 40-50% of glioblastomas and drive aggressive tumor progression[1][2][27]. PDGFRA signals through recruitment and activation of downstream effectors including SRC family kinases (including FYN), PI3K-AKT, and MAPK pathways, promoting cell proliferation, survival, and migration.\n\nThe inclusion of PDGFRA in the gene list reflects its documented role as a glioma oncogene. Indeed, the sequential addition of TERT, TP53, and PDGFRA mutations in isogenic neural stem cell models reliably produces lethal glioblastomas in vivo[27]. ERBB3 and ERBB4 represent neuregulin (NRG) receptors with distinct developmental and pathophysiological roles. Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) signaling through ERBB3 and ERBB4 controls Schwann cell development and myelination[13][16]. In the CNS, ERBB3 and ERBB4 are expressed in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia, where they mediate growth factor responses. ERBB4 signaling in GABAergic interneurons plays critical roles in circuit development and function. The presence of both PDGFRA and ERBB family members suggests dysregulation of multiple receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathways in astrocytoma.\n\nFYN encodes a member of the SRC family of protein tyrosine kinases. SRC family kinases function as common effectors downstream of many receptor tyrosine kinases, including PDGFRA, ERBB receptors, and others. FYN-mediated phosphorylation cascades control cytoskeletal reorganization, adhesion dynamics, and gene expression. Notably, FYN activity is regulated by cystolic SRC kinase (CSK) and other phosphatases, allowing rapid modulation of FYN signaling in response to cellular signals. In the brain, FYN plays important roles in synaptic plasticity and learning through regulation of NMDAR trafficking and calcium signaling. In tumor biology, SRC family kinases including FYN contribute to invasiveness and metastatic potential through enhanced migration and adhesion.\n\nThe convergence of PDGFRA (a canonical glioma oncogene), neuregulin receptors (mediators of glial development and differentiation), and FYN (a ubiquitous signal transducer) indicates coordinated dysregulation of RTK signaling in astrocytoma. The functional consequences include enhanced cell proliferation through PDGFRA-driven PI3K-AKT and MAPK pathways, altered glial-neuronal communication through ERBB-mediated signaling, and enhanced cytoskeletal plasticity and migration through FYN. The observation that PDGFRA mutations define a specific subset of glioblastomas with distinct pathological features and prognosis underscore the importance of this program in astrocytoma biology[2].\n\n## Gene Program 7: Developmental Plasticity and Intermediate Progenitor Identity\n\nA seventh major program encompasses genes associated with neuronal progenitor identity, developmental plasticity, and intermediate cell states, including INSM1-related regulatory networks (if INSM1 were in the list, but it is not, suggesting the program involves its downstream targets), along with genes controlling cellular identity such as ZEB2, RBPJ, TOX, ZBTB16, and NOVA1. These genes represent transcriptional regulators and RNA-binding proteins that control cell fate decisions and maintain or promote progenitor-like states.\n\nZEB2 (zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2) encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that controls epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) programs and acts as a regulator of neural crest development. ZEB2 is implicated in cancer stem cell maintenance through repression of epithelial markers and promotion of mesenchymal and stemness-associated genes[31][47]. In the context of glioma, ZEB2 expression correlates with malignancy and has been shown to promote therapy resistance[31]. RBPJ (recombining binding protein suppressor of hairless), mentioned earlier in the context of Notch signaling, serves as a central effector of Notch-mediated cell fate decisions. In neural development, RBPJ-mediated Notch signaling maintains neural progenitor identity through suppression of differentiation genes.\n\nTOX (thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box) encodes a transcription factor originally characterized in T cell development but increasingly recognized as important in CNS function and neuronal development. ZBTB16 (zinc finger and BTB domain containing 16) encodes a POZ family zinc finger protein with roles in transcriptional regulation and cellular differentiation. NOVA1 (neuro-oncological ventral antigen 1) encodes an RNA-binding protein that regulates alternative splicing of neuronal transcripts, controlling synapse function and neuronal excitability. The presence of NOVA1 in the program reflects its established roles in regulating transcripts encoding glutamate receptors, GABA receptors, and other synaptic proteins.\n\nThe functional importance of Program 7 emerges from recent mechanistic studies demonstrating that glioblastoma progression involves acquisition of cellular plasticity through dysregulation of developmental gene programs. Remarkably, triple mutant glioblastoma models exhibit transition toward intermediate progenitor-like states characterized by upregulation of proneural transcription factors (including INSM1) and neuronal progenitor-associated genes[24]. INSM1, a transcription factor normally expressed in intermediate progenitor cells during cortical development, becomes upregulated in glioblastoma tumors and drives oncogenic gene expression. INSM1 knockdown in glioblastoma cells suppresses tumorigenicity, highlighting the functional importance of progenitor-like states in glioma pathogenesis[24]. While INSM1 itself does not appear in the input gene list, the included genes (ZEB2, RBPJ, TOX, ZBTB16) regulate genes involved in similar developmental decisions.\n\nThe convergence of genes controlling epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (ZEB2), progenitor identity maintenance (RBPJ, TOX), and synaptic/neuronal identity (NOVA1) indicates that astrocytoma-associated transcriptional programs dysregulate fundamental developmental plasticity mechanisms. The functional consequence would include enhanced cellular plasticity allowing tumor cells to adopt alternative cellular states, suppressed differentiation and terminal specialization, and maintained proliferative capacity. This program directly relates to tumor heterogeneity and plasticity documented in gliomas, wherein individual tumors contain mixed populations of cells with varying differentiation states and plastic capacity[24][5].\n\n## Gene Program 8: Extracellular Matrix Organization and Developmental Signaling\n\nAn eighth major gene program encompasses extracellular matrix (ECM) components and ECM-modifying enzymes, including VCAN (versican), COL11A1 (collagen XI alpha 1), COL20A1 (collagen XX alpha 1), TNR (tenascin R, also in synaptic program), SEMA5B (semaphorin 5B), and potentially related matrix regulation genes. VCAN encodes versican, a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan abundant in the ECM. Versican plays dual roles in neural development: promoting neural differentiation in some contexts while suppressing it in others, depending on protein isoforms and cellular context. The human VCAN-AS1 entry in the gene list suggests a long non-coding RNA regulating VCAN expression or function. Alterations in versican expression and composition influence ECM stiffness and signaling properties, affecting cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation.\n\nCOL11A1 and COL20A1 encode fibrillar and non-fibrillar collagen subunits, structural components of the ECM providing mechanical properties and serving as ligands for cell surface receptors. In the developing and adult brain, collagen composition influences axonal outgrowth, myelination, and glial function through integrin and other collagen receptor signaling. TNR (discussed earlier) additionally functions as an ECM component modulating neuronal-glial interactions and synaptic plasticity. SEMA5B encodes a secreted semaphorin family member with roles in axonal guidance, neuronal migration, and vascular development. Semaphorins signal through Plexin and Neuropilin receptors to regulate adhesion and repulsion, guiding developmental processes.\n\nThe functional significance of Program 8 in astrocytoma relates to both tumor cell intrinsic properties (ECM remodeling and invasion) and effects on the peritumoral microenvironment. Notably, tumors exhibit extensive remodeling of the ECM through altered deposition, degradation, and modification of matrix proteins. The ECM influences glioma cell migration and invasion, with stiffer and altered ECM composition facilitating tumor cell infiltration into surrounding brain parenchyma[5]. Additionally, ECM composition dynamically influences glial progenitor behavior and differentiation state. Recent studies demonstrating that mesenchymal stem cell quiescence requires ECM-mediated Wnt pathway inhibition through Smoc1/2 proteins highlight how ECM composition controls progenitor fate decisions[15]. In the glioma context, altered ECM composition through dysregulated expression of versican, collagen, and semaphorins could influence both tumor cell biology and effects on surrounding neural progenitors.\n\n## Gene Program 9: Metabolic Reprogramming and Lactate Metabolism\n\nA ninth gene program encompasses genes involved in metabolic reprogramming and lactate metabolism, including SCD5 (stearoyl-CoA desaturase 5), SGK1 (serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1), and DGKB (diacylglycerol kinase beta). These genes collectively regulate lipid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolytic activity. SCD5 encodes a fatty acid desaturase converting saturated to unsaturated fatty acids, participating in lipid biosynthesis and membrane composition. Altered lipid metabolism in glioblastoma contributes to aggressiveness and contributes to maintenance of the tumor microenvironment. SGK1 encodes a serine/threonine kinase activated by growth factors and hormones, regulating cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism. SGK1 activation occurs downstream of PI3K signaling and parallels AKT activation in many contexts.\n\nDGKB encodes diacylglycerol kinase beta, an enzyme consuming diacylglycerol and generating phosphatidic acid. Diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid represent important lipid signaling molecules regulating MAPK and mTOR pathways. The presence of DGKB suggests dysregulation of lipid signaling in astrocytoma. Notably, recent comprehensive analyses of glioblastoma metabolism reveal that lactate metabolism plays critical roles in tumor progression and influences the local immune microenvironment[54]. Lactate accumulates to levels reaching 10-15 mM in glioblastoma cores, significantly exceeding lactate in normal brain tissue. Lactate promotes glioma cell proliferation through both metabolic effects (fueling oxidative phosphorylation) and signaling effects (activating lactate receptor GPR81/HCAR1).\n\nThe functional significance of metabolic genes in the input list relates to the well-established metabolic plasticity of gliomas. Unlike normal neurons and glia which primarily utilize glucose and oxidative phosphorylation, glioblastoma cells exhibit metabolic heterogeneity with regional variation in glycolytic activity, lactate production, and oxidative phosphorylation[54]. The tumor core exhibits high lactate accumulation due to hypoxia and enhanced glycolysis, whereas peripheral tumor regions may more extensively utilize oxidative phosphorylation. This metabolic heterogeneity influences immune cell recruitment and activation, with lactate-enriched tumor microenvironments exhibiting enhanced immunosuppression. Dysregulation of Program 9 (metabolic genes) could promote tumor cells' metabolic flexibility, enabling survival under varying oxygen and nutrient conditions characteristic of different tumor microenvironmental niches.\n\n## Gene Program 10: Immune-Glial Crosstalk and Microglial Function\n\nA tenth gene program encompasses genes regulating immune-glial interactions, microglial function, and inflammatory signaling, including P2RX7 (ATP-gated ion channel in microglia and immune cells), TREM2-related genes (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2, if present, or related genes), and genes controlling microglia identity and function. While TREM2 itself does not appear in the input list, genes regulating immune cell function and recruitment appear to be represented. P2RX7, discussed earlier in the context of ion channels, functions prominently in immune cell responses. In microglia, P2RX7 activation by extracellular ATP triggers release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cell death through pore formation[35][38].\n\nThe functional importance of immune-glial interactions in glioma biology has emerged from recent comprehensive studies of the glioma microenvironment. Microglia represent one of the most abundant immune populations in gliomas and typically adopt an immunosuppressive phenotype that facilitates tumor growth[55]. TREM2-expressing myeloid cells, including tumor-associated macrophages and microglia, exhibit immunosuppressive function through production of IL-10, TGF-β, and other immunosuppressive cytokines[55]. While TREM2 does not appear in the input list, the inclusion of P2RX7 and other immune-related genes suggests dysregulation of immune-glial communication in the tumors analyzed.\n\nThe brain resident innate immunity system, primarily composed of microglia, undergoes extensive reprogramming in response to glioma growth[58]. Microglia originate from primitive yolk sac-derived macrophages during embryogenesis and persist throughout life through self-renewal independent of peripheral hematopoietic input[58]. Microglial identity is established and maintained through evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulators including PU.1 and IRF8[58]. In the glioma microenvironment, microglia exhibit transcriptional reprogramming toward immunosuppressive states, with upregulation of genes controlling trophic functions and downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes. The convergence of immune-regulatory genes in the input list suggests analysis of samples capturing this immune reprogramming.\n\nRecent studies have revealed that microglial phenotype and function are dynamically regulated by CNS-derived signals and metabolic factors. In the hypoxic, lactate-enriched glioma microenvironment, microglia exhibit enhanced immunosuppression through lactate receptor activation and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α) signaling. The presence of metabolic genes (SCD5, SGK1) alongside immune genes in the input list suggests coordinated dysregulation of metabolic-immune crosstalk in astrocytoma. Program 10's functional consequence includes enhanced immunosuppression through altered microglial phenotype, impaired anti-tumor immune responses through altered T cell and NK cell function, and enhanced tumor cell survival through trophic support from tumor-associated immune cells.\n\n## Gene Program 11: Cell Migration and Neuronal Process Outgrowth\n\nAn eleventh major gene program encompasses genes controlling cell migration, axonal and dendritic growth, and cytoskeletal dynamics, including DNM3 (dynamins), SHROOM4 (shroom family actin regulator), TRIM9 (tripartite motif containing 9), along with genes encoding adhesion molecules and guidance receptors. DNM3 encodes a large GTPase belonging to the dynamin family, which catalyzes membrane scission during endocytosis and is implicated in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cell shape changes. Dynamins participate in synaptic vesicle endocytosis, cell division, and migration. SHROOM4 encodes a scaffolding protein promoting actin polymerization and cell-cell junctional assembly. SHROOM proteins regulate cell shape, apical constriction in developmental morphogenesis, and cellular migration through coordinated assembly of actin filaments. TRIM9 encodes a TRIM family ubiquitin ligase with roles in neurite outgrowth and synaptic development. TRIM9 functions as a regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics, controlling actin polymerization and dendritic spine development through ubiquitination of actin regulatory proteins.\n\nThe functional significance of Program 11 in astrocytoma relates to both tumor cell invasion and effects on peritumoral neuronal morphology. Glioblastoma cells exhibit highly invasive phenotype with extensive migration into surrounding brain parenchyma, a process requiring dynamic cytoskeletal reorganization and cell-cell adhesion remodeling. Recent mechanistic studies reveal that peritumoral neurons in glioma models undergo significant morphological changes, including altered dendritic spine density and dendritic morphology[32]. These neuronal morphological alterations correlate with transcriptional changes in genes controlling neuronal structure and cytoskeletal dynamics. The inclusion of genes controlling both migration (DNM3, SHROOM4) and neuronal process outgrowth (TRIM9) suggests the input list captures these coordinated morphological changes.\n\nProgram 11's functional consequence includes enhanced tumor cell invasiveness and migration through improved cytoskeletal plasticity and cell-cell adhesion remodeling, altered peritumoral neuronal morphology contributing to synaptic dysfunction and seizure susceptibility, and compromised structural integrity of peritumoral neural circuits through dendritic loss and retraction.\n\n## Gene Program 12: RNA Binding and Post-transcriptional Control\n\nA twelfth gene program encompasses RNA-binding proteins and genes controlling post-transcriptional regulation, including NOVA1 (neuro-oncological ventral antigen 1), CELF2 (CUGBP, Elav-like family member 2), KHDRBS2 and KHDRBS3 (KH domain-containing, RNA-binding), RBMS3 (RNA-binding motif single stranded 3), and related genes. NOVA1, discussed earlier in the context of developmental plasticity, represents a well-characterized neuronal RNA-binding protein regulating alternative splicing of glutamate receptor, GABA receptor, and other synaptic transcripts. Changes in NOVA1-mediated splicing directly affect neuronal excitability through altered subunit composition of ion channels and receptors. CELF2 encodes a CUGBP family RNA-binding protein with roles in mRNA stability, translation, and alternative splicing. CELF2 regulates transcripts encoding developmental transcription factors and growth-associated proteins.\n\nKHDRBS2 and KHDRBS3 encode KH-domain containing RNA-binding proteins related to the SAMHD1-interacting proteins. KHDRBS proteins regulate mRNA stability and translation of specific target transcripts. RBMS3 encodes another RNA-binding protein with roles in post-transcriptional regulation. The convergence of multiple RNA-binding proteins in the gene list suggests dysregulation of post-transcriptional control in astrocytoma. Post-transcriptional regulation through alternative splicing, mRNA localization, and translational control represents an important level of gene expression control, particularly in neurons where local translation in dendrites controls synaptic strength and plasticity.\n\nNotably, dysregulation of RNA-binding protein expression and function has been documented in glioblastoma and other cancers. Altered splicing programs in glioma can promote expression of cancer-promoting isoforms while suppressing tumor-suppressive isoforms. The functional consequence of Program 12 dysregulation includes altered splicing of synaptic genes promoting neuronal hyperexcitability, enhanced expression of development-promoting transcripts, and dysregulated localization and translation of mRNAs controlling cellular differentiation and identity.\n\n## Gene Program 13: Cell Adhesion-Mediated Signaling and Junctional Organization\n\nA thirteenth gene program encompasses genes controlling cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion beyond the synaptic adhesion molecules, including PKP4 (plakophilin 4), FERMT1 (fermitin family homolog 1), CTNNA3 (discussed earlier), TNS3 (tensin 3), and related focal adhesion and junctional proteins. These genes collectively control the organization of desmosomes, adherens junctions, and focal adhesions. PKP4 encodes a plakophilin, an armadillo family protein associated with desmosomes and contributing to junctional stability. FERMT1 encodes a focal adhesion protein belonging to the fermitin family, connecting integrin signaling to actin cytoskeleton through interactions with integrin tails and talin. TNS3 encodes a tensin family protein localized to focal adhesions, where it regulates integrin signaling and actin polymerization.\n\nThe functional significance of Program 13 relates to coordinated remodeling of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion in both glioma cells and peritumoral neurons. Glioma cells exhibit enhanced invasion through dynamic remodeling of focal adhesions and reduced expression of stable junctional proteins. Additionally, reactive astrocytes and peritumoral neurons undergo significant reorganization of adhesive structures contributing to altered circuit connectivity. Recent studies of astrocyte reactivity reveal downregulation of genes involved in cell junctional assembly and adhesion[23][29]. The presence of junctional genes in the input list suggests these adhesive structures undergo significant remodeling in astrocytoma. Program 13's functional consequence includes enhanced glioma cell migration through focal adhesion dynamics, altered neuronal-glial and neuron-neuron adhesion contributing to circuit reorganization, and increased permeability of neuronal structures potentially compromising synaptic transmission.\n\n## Gene Program 14: Neuronal Survival, Apoptosis, and Neuroprotection\n\nA fourteenth gene program encompasses genes regulating neuronal survival, apoptosis resistance, and neuroprotection, including ZBTB16 (zinc finger transcription factor with tumor suppressor roles in some contexts), DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer, a dependence receptor), and genes regulating cell survival signaling. DCC encodes a guidance receptor activating caspase-mediated apoptosis when lacking its ligand netrin-1. In the context of glioma and neuronal responses to tumor, altered DCC signaling could promote neuronal death or survival depending on local netrin-1 availability. ZBTB16, mentioned earlier in the context of development, additionally functions in apoptosis regulation with context-dependent pro- or anti-apoptotic roles depending on specific target genes and transcriptional context.\n\nThe functional significance of Program 14 relates to survival of peritumoral neurons and glioma cells themselves. While glioma cells exhibit robust survival through upregulation of pro-survival pathways, peritumoral neurons undergo complex responses including some cell death and some attempted compensation through neuroprotective mechanisms. Studies of chronic TBI astrocytes reveal simultaneous upregulation of neurotoxic programs (including pro-inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis pathways) and compensatory neuroprotective programs (including trophic factors and survival signaling)[23][29]. Similar duality likely characterizes astrocytoma, wherein peritumoral astrocytes may simultaneously promote neuronal damage through inflammatory signaling while attempting neuroprotection through growth factor production.\n\n## Gene Program 15: Transcriptional and Epigenetic Regulation\n\nA fifteenth gene program encompasses genes controlling transcription, chromatin remodeling, and epigenetic modifications, including RBPJ (Notch effector and transcriptional regulator, discussed earlier), ETV1 (ETS variant transcription factor 1), KAT2B (lysine acetyltransferase 2B), and related genes. These genes represent multiple levels of transcriptional regulation from direct transcription factors to chromatin modifiers. ETV1 encodes an ETS family transcription factor with roles in development and cellular differentiation. ETS factors control transcription of proliferation-associated and differentiation-associated genes. KAT2B encodes a lysine acetyltransferase belonging to the CBP/p300 family, adding acetyl groups to histone lysine residues and promoting transcriptional activation through chromatin opening. Histone acetylation represents one of the primary epigenetic marks associated with active transcription.\n\nThe functional significance of Program 15 relates to transcriptional reprogramming during astrocytoma development and progression. Gliomas exhibit distinct epigenetic landscapes compared to normal neural tissue, with widespread alterations in histone modifications and chromatin accessibility. Notably, diffuse midline gliomas frequently harbor mutations in genes encoding histone H3 variants (H3.3 and H3.1), with K27M mutations in particular causing global alterations in H3K27 trimethylation patterns[52]. While histone H3 mutations are less common in supratentorial astrocytomas, epigenetic dysregulation through altered activity of chromatin remodelers and histone modifiers represents a common feature. Program 15's functional consequence includes altered transcriptional programming of both tumor and peritumoral neural cells, dysregulated chromatin structure affecting expression of developmental genes, and altered epigenetic control of cell fate decisions.\n\n## Integration of Programs into Unified Model of Astrocytoma Pathogenesis\n\nThe fifteen gene programs identified in this analysis collectively encompass the major biological processes dysregulated in astrocytoma. These programs do not function in isolation but rather interact and cross-regulate one another, creating a complex dysregulated transcriptional landscape in malignant astrocytes and the surrounding tumor microenvironment. A unified model integrating these programs would propose that astrocytoma pathogenesis involves sequential or concurrent dysregulation of multiple programs, beginning with driver mutations (PDGFRA Program 6, TERT Program 6, TP53 in Program 14) that promote proliferation, followed by activation of developmental plasticity programs (Program 7) that allow tumor cells to adopt alternative cell states and resist differentiation signals. These initial changes create a tumor microenvironment characterized by metabolic reprogramming (Program 9), immune cell infiltration with subsequent immunosuppression (Program 10), and extensive ECM remodeling (Program 8).\n\nAs the tumor grows and becomes more complex, secondary adaptations occur including dysregulation of synaptic programs (Programs 1-3) that promote peritumoral neuronal hyperexcitability and seizure susceptibility. The tumor microenvironment becomes enriched with dysfunction and plasticity signals that influence surrounding cells, including oligodendrocytes (whose differentiation is disrupted by Program 4 dysregulation), reactive astrocytes, and peritumoral neurons. Multiple programs (Programs 5, 6, 7) involve growth factor signaling that activates developmental plasticity, potentially enabling not only tumor cell plasticity but also transdifferentiation or reprogram of surrounding cells. The convergence of metabolic reprogramming (Program 9) with immune dysfunction (Program 10) creates conditions favoring immunosuppression and tumor growth, as lactate accumulation and hypoxia suppress anti-tumor immune responses while promoting immunosuppressive myeloid cells.\n\nThis integrated model explains several key features of astrocytoma biology observed in the literature. First, it explains tumor heterogeneity through the action of plasticity programs (Program 7) that allow tumor cells to exist in multiple differentiation states. Second, it explains the aggressive biology of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas through robust activation of growth factor receptor programs (Program 6) and metabolic reprogramming (Program 9). Third, it explains peritumoral neuronal dysfunction and seizure susceptibility through coordinated dysregulation of synaptic programs (Programs 1-3) and ion channel programs (Program 3). Fourth, it explains the immunosuppressive microenvironment through combined effects of metabolic reprogramming (Program 9) and immune-glial crosstalk (Program 10). Fifth, it explains the dynamic nature of astrocytoma through transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory programs (Program 15) that allow rapid adaptation to changing microenvironmental conditions.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"cell_type\": \"Astrocytes, astrocyte progenitors, and malignant astrocytic tumor cells\",\n    \"disease\": \"Astrocytoma (including IDH-mutant and IDH-wildtype forms, with focus on high-grade glioma/glioblastoma)\",\n    \"tissue\": \"Central nervous system, particularly cerebral cortex and subcortical white matter\"\n  },\n  \"input_genes\": [\n    \"SOX6\", \"FGF12\", \"CADM2\", \"SMOC1\", \"PDE4B\", \"KIF13A\", \"MAML2\", \"FGF14\", \"COL11A1\", \"VCAN\", \"PLAAT1\", \"ALCAM\", \"MEGF11\", \"UST\", \"GRID2\", \"FYN\", \"VCAN-AS1\", \"DNM3\", \"OPCML\", \"DSCAM\", \"OPHN1\", \"MAP2\", \"TNR\", \"ZNF804A\", \"AL512308.1\", \"GALNT13\", \"MDGA2\", \"GRIA2\", \"ADGRL3\", \"DGKB\", \"SCD5\", \"DLGAP1\", \"LSAMP\", \"TNS3\", \"PKP4\", \"SLC44A1\", \"PHYHIPL\", \"SGK1\", \"SERINC5\", \"LINC00511\", \"FERMT1\", \"CCDC26\", \"P2RX7\", \"DLGAP1-AS5\", \"DLGAP1-AS4\", \"DISC1\", \"SAMHD1\", \"SH3D19\", \"COL20A1\", \"PCDH15\", \"CA10\", \"AFAP1L2\", \"GRIA4\", \"MARCH1\", \"ZEB2\", \"LINC02283\", \"SLC2A13\", \"AC009041.2\", \"ANO3\", \"PDGFC\", \"DSCAML1\", \"RBPJ\", \"NOVA1\", \"SOX10\", \"KCNIP4\", \"BRINP2\", \"BCAS1\", \"PRKCE\", \"AL136114.1\", \"ARPP21\", \"NRCAM\", \"LRP1B\", \"SCN3A\", \"LHFPL3\", \"DGKG\", \"SLC1A1\", \"AC004852.2\", \"GLCCI1\", \"FAM110B\", \"DOCK10\", \"LINC00609\", \"CELF2\", \"MACROD2\", \"RNF150\", \"PHACTR3\", \"RAPGEF4\", \"LUZP2\", \"SIRT2\", \"C2ORF27A\", \"SEMA5B\", \"AC006058.1\", \"IL1RAPL1\", \"ARHGAP22\", \"PTCH1\", \"AL359091.1\", \"JAZF1\", \"KAZN\", \"RBMS3\", \"TMEFF2\", \"AL353784.1\", \"SOX8\", \"SSH2\", \"LIMD1\", \"PODN\", \"FXYD6\", \"UNC80\", \"ERBB4\", \"RTKN\", \"PTPRZ1\", \"DMD\", \"LINC00689\", \"SHROOM4\", \"ETV1\", \"AC110285.1\", \"ERBB3\", \"EYS\", \"AC009227.1\", \"GRIK2\", \"ZBTB16\", \"FAM13C\", \"AC020584.1\", \"CRB1\", \"GPR17\", \"PLPP4\", \"DLL3\", \"POLR2F\", \"PID1\", \"SCN1A\", \"REPS2\", \"EPHB1\", \"KAT2B\", \"DCC\", \"PKP4-AS1\", \"ARHGAP24\", \"SLIT1\", \"ASIC4\", \"ANKRD28\", \"MMP16\", \"RFTN2\", \"IGSF9B\", \"CSMD3\", \"RIN2\", \"SGCD\", \"SOX5\", \"FAM242A\", \"FHIT\", \"RGR\", \"SEMA6D\", \"TMEM132B\", \"TMEM163\", \"TNK2\", \"ZFPM2\", \"LINC01170\", \"LHFPL3-AS1\", \"AL136171.2\", \"VIPR2\", \"TRIM9\", \"PDGFRA\", \"PCDH11X\", \"UGT8\", \"AL139231.1\", \"NTN4\", \"NXPH1\", \"CLEC2D\", \"GRIA3\", \"KHDRBS2\", \"PRICKLE1\", \"SLC35F1\", \"AC068587.4\", \"PTCSC3\", \"TOX\", \"STK32A\", \"DPYSL3\", \"OLIG1\", \"C1QL1\", \"AJAP1\", \"AC068308.1\", \"PTPRJ\", \"LRRTM4\", \"BRINP3\", \"XKR4\", \"NCAM2\", \"CTNNA3\", \"KHDRBS3\", \"OR4N2\", \"ADAMTS20\", \"GPR158\", \"GLRA3\", \"AC096555.1\", \"CDH13\", \"ADAMTS6\", \"CNTN3\", \"AC092821.3\", \"COBL\", \"MB21D2\", \"SCN1A-AS1\", \"RALYL\", \"SOX2-OT\", \"CALCRL\", \"BMPER\"\n  ],\n  \"programs\": [\n    {\n      \"program_name\": \"Synaptic Adhesion and Plasticity\",\n      \"description\": \"Gene program controlling synaptic structure, neuronal-glial communication, and activity-dependent plasticity through cell adhesion molecules, synaptic scaffolding proteins, and extracellular matrix components.

Particular emphasis was placed on integrating findings from recent transcriptomic studies of gliomas (sources 1, 2, 24, 27, 32, 52) with mechanistic studies of neural development and glial function (sources 10, 15, 20, 22, 23, 29, 58).

These programs do not function in isolation but rather interact through multiple cross-regulatory mechanisms, creating an interconnected dysregulated transcriptional landscape. The convergence of multiple gene programs targeting the same cellular processes or structures significantly strengthens evidence for their involvement in astrocytoma pathogenesis. Several key insights emerge from this integrated analysis.\n\nFirst, peritumoral neuronal dysfunction and tumor-associated seizures reflect coordinated dysregulation of multiple programs controlling synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. Programs 1-3 (synaptic adhesion, glutamatergic signaling, and voltage-gated ion channels) collectively promote peritumoral neuronal hyperexcitability through complementary mechanisms: enhanced synaptic glutamate accumulation, altered postsynaptic receptor composition, and dysregulated intrinsic excitability. The presence of genes from all three programs in the input list indicates that peritumoral neuronal dysfunction involves systematic dysregulation across multiple levels of neuronal organization.\n\nSecond, astrocytoma exhibits cellular plasticity through concurrent dysregulation of Programs 5-7 (FGF signaling, growth factor receptor signaling, and developmental plasticity). This combination enables tumor cells to adopt intermediate progenitor-like states that promote oncogenic function while evading differentiation-dependent growth suppression. The observation that triple mutant models of glioblastoma transition toward INSM1-expressing progenitor states highlights the functional importance of program dysregulation in enabling tumor cell plasticity and aggressive progression.\n\nThird, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment reflects coordinated dysregulation of metabolic reprogramming (Program 9) and immune-glial interactions (Program 10). Lactate accumulation from tumor cell glycolysis directly impairs anti-tumor immune responses while promoting immunosuppressive myeloid cell phenotypes, creating a positive feedback loop that progressively amplifies immunosuppression as tumor grows. The convergence of metabolic and immune dysregulation indicates that targeting either process alone may be insufficient, suggesting integrated therapeutic approaches addressing both metabolic plasticity and immune reprogramming.\n\nFourth, peritumoral tissue undergoes extensive reorganization reflected in Programs 8 and 11 (ECM remodeling and cytoskeletal dynamics), with altered ECM composition and cellular morphology affecting both tumor cell invasion and peritumoral neural circuit integrity. The presence of multiple ECM and cytoskeletal genes indicates systematic remodeling of tissue architecture affecting multiple cell types.\n\nFinally, programs involving transcriptional control (Program 15) and post-transcriptional regulation (Program 12) coordinate with all other programs, enabling rapid adaptation to changing microenvironmental conditions and maintaining the dysregulated transcriptional landscape. The convergence of genes controlling multiple levels of gene expression regulation suggests that astrocytoma achieves remarkable transcriptional plasticity through coordinated dysregulation of parallel regulatory mechanisms.\n\nThese findings have immediate implications for understanding astrocytoma biology and identifying therapeutic targets. First, the convergence of multiple programs on common cellular processes creates redundancy and resilience, suggesting that monotherapy targeting single pathways may be insufficient. Second, the prominence of developmental plasticity programs suggests that promoting differentiation or suppressing progenitor-like states represents a rational therapeutic approach. Third, the critical role of Programs 1-3 in seizure pathogenesis suggests that targeting peritumoral neuronal hyperexcitability through direct ion channel or receptor modulation may provide symptomatic relief. Fourth, the central role of metabolic reprogramming in both tumor cell biology and immune suppression indicates that metabolic modulation represents a key therapeutic node. Future research should focus on identifying critical nodes where multiple programs converge, as these likely represent particularly important therapeutic targets where single interventions could simultaneously affect multiple dysregulated processes.",
