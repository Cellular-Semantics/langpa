Through systematic integration of current literature, we have identified interconnected biological programs that operate across inflammatory signaling, extracellular matrix remodeling, cellular migration, metabolic adaptation, and tumor-supportive functions. The gene list demonstrates substantial representation of canonical reactive astrocyte markers alongside emerging mediators of astrocytoma pathogenesis, including transcriptional regulators, cytoskeletal reorganization factors, and microenvironmental modulators. These programs collectively illustrate how astrocytes transition from homeostatic states to reactive, pro-inflammatory, pro-tumoral phenotypes characteristic of astrocytic disease, with particular emphasis on the molecular mechanisms underlying sustained activation patterns observed in both acute brain injury models and malignant astrocytoma progression.\n\n## Molecular Basis of Acute Neuroinflammatory Activation in Astrocytes\n\nAstrocytes represent the most abundant glial cells within the central nervous system and undergo profound phenotypic transformation following injury or neoplastic transformation[51]. The neuroinflammatory response program represents one of the most highly conserved and rapidly activated gene programs in reactive astrocytes, characterized by robust upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and immune signaling molecules. Within the provided gene list, multiple key mediators of acute inflammatory signaling demonstrate coordinated expression patterns consistent with the \"A1-like\" neuroinflammatory phenotype originally characterized in reactive astrocyte models[3][7][28].\n\nThe chemokine system constitutes a central node in astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation. CCL2, also known as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, functions as a critical regulator of microglial recruitment and immune cell infiltration into brain parenchyma[3][28]. CCL2 expression in astrocytes during acute injury phases drives leukocyte migration and cell chemotaxis through engagement of cognate chemokine receptors on immune effector cells[3]. The presence of IL6R and IL1R1 in the gene list reflects astrocytes' capacity to respond to and amplify inflammatory signals initiated by pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and interleukin-1, respectively[3][10]. IL1RAP, the IL-1 receptor accessory protein, cooperates with IL1R1 to enable high-affinity IL-1 binding and downstream signal transduction[3], substantially amplifying the inflammatory response cascade.\n\nThe transcriptional regulatory architecture of neuroinflammatory astrocyte activation centers upon signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which functions as a master regulator of pro-inflammatory gene expression[3][34]. In acute traumatic brain injury models, STAT3 exhibits prominent upregulation within astrocytes, driving transcription of downstream inflammatory targets including TNF, CCL2, and IL-6[34][66]. The inclusion of STAT3 within the gene list identifies its role as a critical hub coordinating rapid inflammatory responses in activated astrocytes. Complementary transcriptional regulators including EGR1, JUNB, and FOS function as immediate early response genes whose rapid induction following injury triggers cascading inflammatory gene expression programs[3][7][34]. These transcription factors collectively orchestrate the temporal dynamics of acute neuroinflammatory responses, with early upregulation at 2 days post-injury followed by partial resolution by 2 weeks in subacute phases[3][34].\n\nToll-like receptor signaling represents an additional critical axis of astrocyte activation, with components including TLR2 and MYD88 identified as prominently enriched in acute reactive astrocytes[3][28]. Toll-like receptors recognize pathogen-associated and danger-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs), initiating innate immune responses through adapter proteins including MYD88, ultimately converging upon NFkappaB and MAPK signaling cascades[3]. While classical TLR signaling components do not appear in the current gene list, the inclusion of downstream transcriptional targets indicates comprehensive representation of acute inflammatory pathways. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interferon-alpha (IFN-α) signaling pathways demonstrate prominent enrichment in acute TBI astrocytes through gene set enrichment analysis[3][7][28], though direct interferon genes do not appear in the current list, suggesting the gene list captures predominantly downstream effector molecules rather than primary cytokine producers.\n\nThe complement system constitutes an additional layer of innate immune activation in reactive astrocytes, with C1R (complement component 1, r subcomponent) and C3 represented in the gene list[28]. Complement activation through classical pathway initiation via C1R and subsequent C3 cleavage propagates amplification of inflammatory cascades and facilitates immune cell recruitment[3][28]. This representation underscores the multifaceted nature of astrocyte-driven neuroinflammation, integrating signals from pathogen recognition receptors, complement activation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling.\n\n## Extracellular Matrix Remodeling and Tissue Microenvironment Sculpting\n\nBeyond inflammatory signaling, reactive astrocytes undergo profound reorganization of the extracellular matrix (ECM), a process that fundamentally reshapes the brain microenvironment and creates conditions either promoting neuroprotection or neurotoxicity depending on temporal dynamics and cytokine context[3][34][51][67]. The ECM remodeling program integrates structural proteins, proteolytic enzymes, their inhibitors, and regulatory molecules that collectively orchestrate matrix composition changes accompanying astrocyte activation.\n\nFibronectin (FN1), a major ECM glycoprotein, demonstrates dynamic upregulation in activated astrocytes and functions as a critical scaffold for cell migration, adhesion, and inflammatory cell recruitment[34][51][67]. FN1 exists in multiple isoforms generated through alternative splicing, with specific variants promoting leukocyte infiltration and regulating interaction between astrocytes and endothelial cells[67]. The inclusion of FN1 in the gene list highlights its dual roles in both structural ECM organization and inflammatory cell guidance. Collagen genes including COL4A1, COL4A2, and COL8A1 represent additional major ECM structural components whose expression patterns shift during astrocyte activation[34][51][67]. Type IV collagen (encoded by COL4A1 and COL4A2) constitutes a primary component of basement membranes surrounding blood vessels and forms a critical interface between astrocytes and the vasculature[67]. Type VIII collagen (COL8A1) localizes to cell surfaces and matrix assemblies adjacent to reactive astrocytes[34].\n\nThe tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) family, represented by TIMP3 in the gene list, plays essential roles in regulating matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and modulating ECM turnover rates[3][34]. While classical MMPs do not appear in the provided gene list, TIMP3 upregulation within reactive astrocytes suggests compensatory regulation of proteolytic activity, potentially constraining excessive matrix degradation during early injury phases when ECM preservation may promote neuronal survival[3][34]. TIMP3 inhibits multiple MMPs and TNFα-converting enzyme (TACE), thereby affecting both ECM composition and inflammatory signaling[34][43].\n\nSPARC (secreted protein acidic and cysteine rich) and SPARCL1 represent additional ECM-associated proteins prominent in subacute reactive astrocytes[34][51]. SPARC functions as an ECM protein that regulates collagen deposition and cell-matrix interactions while simultaneously promoting synapse pruning through engagement of thrombospondin pathways[34][51]. Increased SPARC expression in the subacute phase of TBI (2 weeks post-injury) correlates with transitions toward neurodegenerative processes and synapse elimination[34][51], suggesting that SPARC upregulation marks the transition from acute inflammation toward chronic neurodegeneration.\n\nClustering (CLU) and other members of the serum amyloid A (SAA) family appear relevant to ECM remodeling and inflammation. While SAA1 does not appear in the current list, CLU functions as a secreted chaperone protein involved in protein aggregation, amyloid clearance, and ECM organization[34][51]. CLU upregulation in chronic TBI astrocytes correlates with increased amyloid-beta burden and progression toward Alzheimer's disease-like pathology[34][51]. The appearance of CLU in the gene list reflects its multifunctional roles in both acute inflammatory responses and chronic neurodegenerative transitions.\n\nAdditional ECM-modifying enzymes and receptors include ADAMTS9 (a disintegrin-like and metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif member 9), which functions in ECM remodeling through proteolytic degradation of versican, aggrecan, and other proteoglycans[34]. ADAMTS9 upregulation in reactive astrocytes participates in ECM restructuring that simultaneously enables cellular migration and modulates growth factor bioavailability through matrix reorganization.\n\n## Oxidative Stress Response and Metabolic Adaptation Programs\n\nReactive astrocytes experience profound alterations in oxidative stress burden and metabolic substrate utilization, reflected in this gene list through multiple mediators of antioxidant responses and metabolic enzymes. The oxidative stress response program encompasses both reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation pathways and antioxidant defense mechanisms, with the balance between these processes determining whether astrocytes exhibit neuroprotective or neurotoxic phenotypes[3][7][28].\n\nSOD2 (superoxide dismutase 2), the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, represents a critical antioxidant defense enzyme whose upregulation accompanies acute astrocyte activation[3][7][28][34]. SOD2 catalyzes conversion of superoxide anions to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen, mitigating oxidative damage to mitochondrial proteins and DNA[3][28]. Notably, gene set enrichment analysis of acute TBI astrocytes reveals prominent enrichment in reactive oxygen species production pathways[3][28], suggesting simultaneous upregulation of both pro-oxidant and antioxidant machinery. This apparent paradox reflects astrocytes' dual capacity to generate inflammatory ROS signals while simultaneously activating protective antioxidant responses[3][7]. The subacute phase (2 weeks post-injury) demonstrates downregulation of most acute inflammatory genes while maintaining or increasing expression of antioxidant genes including SOD2, indicating a transition toward metabolic stabilization and homeostatic recovery[34][66].\n\nPFKFB3 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3) functions as a critical metabolic regulator at the intersection of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis[34][51]. PFKFB3 catalyzes synthesis of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, a potent allosteric activator of phosphofructokinase, thereby promoting glycolytic flux[34]. In astrocytes, PFKFB3 upregulation accompanies reactive transformation and correlates with enhanced glycolytic metabolism providing ATP and reducing equivalents for biosynthetic processes supporting immune functions[3][34][51]. This metabolic shift toward glycolysis-dependent energy production represents a hallmark of pro-inflammatory astrocyte phenotypes and contrasts with quiescent astrocyte metabolism that relies more heavily on oxidative phosphorylation[34][51].\n\nGLUL (glutaminase 1), also known as GLS, catalyzes conversion of glutamine to glutamate, a central neurotransmitter and immunometabolic signaling molecule[34][51]. GLUL upregulation in reactive astrocytes increases glutamate production, simultaneously supporting excitatory neurotransmission while providing glutamate for immune cell metabolism and nitric oxide synthesis[34][51][66]. The inclusion of GLUL in the gene list reflects astrocytes' role as metabolic hubs regulating amino acid homeostasis during reactive transformation. NAMPT (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase), represented in the gene list, catalyzes synthesis of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor for NAD+ biosynthesis[56]. NAMPT upregulation in activated astrocytes supports increased NAD+-dependent processes including SIRT1 signaling, PARP-mediated DNA repair, and mitochondrial function, suggesting metabolic adaptation to increased biosynthetic demands accompanying immune activation[34][51].\n\nThe metabolic transition observed in reactive astrocytes reflects broader principles of metabolic reprogramming accompanying immune cell activation. Acute pro-inflammatory astrocytes exhibit reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and increased reliance on aerobic glycolysis, a metabolic pattern analogous to the Warburg effect observed in cancer cells[34][51]. This metabolic shift simultaneously reduces mitochondrial ROS production while increasing cytosolic ATP and reducing equivalents for biosynthesis of inflammatory mediators, ECM proteins, and other factors supporting immune responses[34][51]. Remarkably, the chronic phase of TBI reveals upregulation of both oxidative phosphorylation pathways and glycolytic pathways[34], suggesting metabolic reprogramming toward utilization of multiple substrate oxidation pathways and potential metabolic heterogeneity within astrocyte populations[34][43].\n\n## Cytoskeletal Reorganization and Cell Migration Program\n\nReactive astrocytes undergo dramatic morphological transformation from resting ramified states with numerous fine processes to activated hypertrophic states with thick primary processes[51]. This morphological change involves profound reorganization of the cytoskeleton, mediated by both actin-binding proteins and microtubule-associated factors. The cytoskeletal reorganization program encompasses structural proteins, regulatory kinases, and adaptor molecules coordinating cytoskeletal dynamics with cell adhesion and signaling responses.\n\nVIM (vimentin), the primary intermediate filament protein of astrocytes, demonstrates robust upregulation following astrocyte activation[3][7][28][34][51]. Vimentin functions as a structural scaffold organizing the astrocyte cytoplasm and enables rapid morphological remodeling during reactive transformation[3][34]. Vimentin upregulation correlates directly with acquisition of pro-inflammatory and pro-migratory phenotypes in activated astrocytes[3][7][34][51][66]. ACTN1 (alpha-actinin-1), an actin-binding protein that crosslinks actin filaments and links them to focal adhesion complexes, demonstrates upregulation in reactive astrocytes[3][34][51]. ACTN1 mutations and variations in ACTN4 (alpha-actinin-4) alter cytoskeletal association and focal adhesion dynamics, affecting astrocyte migration and morphological flexibility[34][51][66].\n\nVCL (vinculin) represents a critical focal adhesion protein linking actin filaments to integrin-mediated adhesion complexes[34][51]. Vinculin functions as a mechanotransducer, translating physical tension within the actin cytoskeleton into signaling outputs affecting cell migration, gene expression, and differentiation[34][51][66]. The inclusion of VCL in the gene list reflects its essential roles in coordinating cytoskeletal organization with cell adhesion and migration responses. CNN3 (calponin 3) and TPM4 (tropomyosin 4) function as actin-modulating proteins that regulate thin filament dynamics and actin-myosin interactions[34][51][66]. These proteins coordinate with VIM, ACTN1, and VCL to establish the actin network architecture enabling astrocyte motility and morphological flexibility during reactive transformation.\n\nMicrotubule-associated proteins represent an additional major component of cytoskeletal reorganization. MAP1B (microtubule-associated protein 1B) localizes to dynamic microtubule regions and regulates axon and dendrite morphology during development; upregulation in astrocytes may facilitate processes involving astrocyte process extension and retraction[34][51]. Gap junctional communication, mediated through connexins including those regulated by cytoskeletal proteins, becomes dynamically altered during astrocyte activation, affecting intercellular communication and metabolite exchange[3][34][51].\n\n## Reactive Astrocyte Activation Markers and Pan-Reactive Phenotypes\n\nBeyond specific functional programs, certain genes serve as canonical markers of astrocyte reactivity, demonstrating rapid and consistent upregulation across diverse injury contexts and disease states. GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), the most widely used marker of astrocytes and astrocyte reactivity, appears prominently in the gene list and in the literature as a fundamental marker of both basal astrocyte identity and reactive transformation[3][7][9][28][34][51][66]. GFAP upregulation commences within hours of CNS injury and persists throughout chronic phases, making it a reliable indicator of sustained astrocyte activation[3][7][28][34][51][66].\n\nCD44, the cell adhesion molecule and receptor for hyaluronic acid, demonstrates robust upregulation in reactive astrocytes and functions both as a pan-reactive marker and as an active participant in cell migration, proliferation, and survival signaling[3][34][51][66]. CD44 upregulation in astrocytes accompanies acquisition of invasive phenotypes and correlates with astrocyte-derived progenitor cell emergence[34][43][51]. The multiple isoforms of CD44 generated through alternative splicing exhibit context-dependent functions, with variant isoforms promoting cell migration and stemness acquisition[34][51].\n\nSERPINA3 (serpin family A member 3), also known as alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, functions as both a serine protease inhibitor and a pan-reactive astrocyte marker[3][7][28][34][51][66]. SERPINA3 upregulation in reactive astrocytes correlates with neuroinflammatory activation and anti-inflammatory neuroprotective functions[34][51][66]. Notably, SERPINA3 exhibits particular prominence in chronic TBI astrocytes, where it associates with neurogenic potential and cognitive improvement[34][43]. The dual expression of SERPINA3 alongside pro-inflammatory cytokines reflects astrocytes' capacity to simultaneously express pro-inflammatory and neuroprotective factors, confounding simplistic \"A1/A2\" classification schemes[34][43][51].\n\nCHI3L1 (chitinase-3-like protein 1), also known as YKL-40, represents an additional pan-reactive astrocyte marker and immune-modulating protein[19][34][51]. CHI3L1 functions as a secreted glycoprotein with immune-regulatory functions and predicts disease progression in multiple neuroinflammatory conditions[19][34][51]. CHI3L1 upregulation in astrocytes correlates with both early inflammation and chronic neurodegeneration, indicating its role across multiple phases of reactive astrocyte transformation[34][51][66]. The inclusion of CHI3L1 in the gene list reflects its importance as both a canonical reactive astrocyte marker and a mediator of immune-metabolic signaling.\n\n## Synaptic Interaction, Synapse Pruning, and Neuronal-Glial Communication\n\nWhile astrocytes traditionally have been viewed as passive support cells, emerging evidence emphasizes their active roles in regulating synapse formation, refinement, and elimination. The synaptic interaction program encompasses genes mediating astrocyte-neuron contacts, synapse-associated protein expression, and factors regulating synaptic pruning and phagocytosis.\n\nNRCAM (neuronal cell adhesion molecule), also known as neurofascin-186, functions as an astrocyte-expressed cell adhesion molecule mediating astrocyte-neuron interactions and contributing to synapse stability[34][43][51]. NRCAM downregulation occurs in acute reactive astrocytes while showing re-expression in subacute and chronic phases, suggesting dynamic modulation of astrocyte-neuron adhesion during different phases of reactive transformation[34][43]. CLCF1 (ciliary neurotrophic factor family cytokine-like factor 1) represents a cytokine-like mediator of neuroprotective signaling between astrocytes and neurons[3][34][51]. CLCF1 activation of CNTFR (ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor) on neurons promotes neuronal survival and plasticity, representing a neuroprotective function of reactive astrocytes[34][51][66].\n\nThe synapse pruning program centers upon molecules mediating astrocyte-dependent elimination of synapses and neuronal projections. SPARC and SPARCL1 promote synapse pruning through interaction with thrombospondin-binding integrins on astrocytes[34][51][67]. Complement components C1Q and related factors facilitate astrocyte-mediated phagocytosis of synaptic material through complement-dependent mechanisms[3][34][51]. MERTK (MER proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase), while not appearing in the current gene list, represents a critical \"find me\" receptor driving astrocyte-mediated synaptic engulfment; however, related phosphatidylserine recognition pathways may involve proteins within the current list[34][51].\n\nThe transition from acute inflammation toward synapse pruning occurs in subacute phases of TBI, with genes mediating synapse elimination showing selective upregulation at 2 weeks post-injury while many acute inflammatory genes decline[34][51][66]. This temporal pattern suggests active astrocyte remodeling of synaptic organization during the transition from acute injury toward chronic phases, potentially contributing to synaptic dysfunction and long-term cognitive deficits characteristic of TBI survivors[34][51][66].\n\n## Transcriptional Regulation of Reactive Phenotypes and Stress Response Pathways\n\nThe temporal dynamics of astrocyte activation involve rapid, sequential changes in transcription factor expression that coordinately regulate gene programs underlying reactive transformation. Multiple transcriptional regulators within the gene list coordinate the transition from resting to reactive states and subsequently from acute inflammation toward chronic neurodegeneration.\n\nJUN (c-Jun) and JUNB (JunB), members of the AP-1 transcription factor family, demonstrate rapid upregulation in response to injury stimuli and inflammatory signals[3][7][28][34]. JUN and JUNB heterodimerize with FOS (c-Fos) and FOSL2 (FosL2) to form AP-1 complexes that coordinately regulate transcription of inflammatory genes, metabolic enzymes, and cytoskeletal proteins[3][34][51][66]. AP-1 complex formation occurs within hours of injury, providing rapid transcriptional responses to danger signals[3][7][28]. Notably, JUNB and EGR1 expression decline in the subacute phase while remaining elevated in chronic TBI astrocytes, suggesting selective temporal control of immediate early response genes across reactive phases[3][34][66].\n\nEGR1 (early growth response 1), a zinc-finger transcription factor, functions as an immediate early response gene whose expression is induced by diverse stress stimuli and growth factors[21][34][51]. EGR1 upregulation in acute reactive astrocytes reflects rapid transcriptional response to injury signals; however, EGR1 expression decreases in subacute phases while remaining elevated in chronic astrocytes, indicating temporal modulation of early response gene expression[34][66]. EGR1 target genes include multiple inflammatory mediators, growth factors, and cell cycle regulators, making EGR1 a critical hub coordinating astrocyte reactive responses[34][51][66].\n\nATF3 (activating transcription factor 3) and related ATF/CREB family members regulate stress response pathways including unfolded protein response (UPR) and integrated stress response (ISR) programs[34][51]. ATF3 upregulation in astrocytes accompanies metabolic stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, activating transcriptional programs that simultaneously increase stress-responsive chaperones and reduce protein synthesis[34][51]. The prominence of ATF3 in reactive astrocytes reflects their experience of multiple forms of cellular stress accompanying inflammatory activation and metabolic reprogramming.\n\nSTAT3, previously discussed in the context of inflammatory signaling, functions simultaneously as an effector of cytokine signaling and as a transcriptional regulator of differentiation and metabolic programs[3][26][34][51]. STAT3 phosphorylation downstream of IL-6, IL-10, and other cytokine signals enables nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of target genes including SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 3)[8][34][51]. SOCS3, represented in the gene list, constitutes a negative feedback regulator of cytokine signaling that prevents excessive inflammatory responses[8][34][51]. The upregulation of both STAT3 and SOCS3 in reactive astrocytes reflects activation of cytokine signaling coupled with induction of negative feedback mechanisms limiting signal intensity[34][51].\n\nKLF6 and KLF7 (Krüppel-like factors 6 and 7) function as transcriptional regulators of cell differentiation, proliferation, and inflammatory responses[34][51][66]. KLF family members display dynamic expression during astrocyte activation, with selective upregulation in chronic phases correlating with stabilization of activated states[34][66]. These transcriptional regulators represent emerging nodes in the transcriptional control network regulating astrocyte fate decisions and phenotype stability.\n\n## Growth Factor Signaling and Cellular Proliferation Programs\n\nReactive astrocytes undergo dramatic transitions in proliferation rates, with acute phases (0-3 days post-injury) showing modest increases in proliferation that progressively increase in subacute phases (1-2 weeks) and persist into chronic phases[34][43][51]. Growth factor signaling pathways, particularly those mediated by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), orchestrate astrocyte proliferation and differentiation decisions.\n\nTGFB2 (transforming growth factor-beta 2) and TGFBR2 (transforming growth factor-beta receptor 2) represent critical nodes of TGF-β signaling within astrocytes[34][51]. TGF-β signaling through TGFBR1/TGFBR2 heterodimeric complexes and SMAD-dependent downstream effectors regulates astrocyte proliferation, differentiation, and immunosuppressive functions[34][51]. The upregulation of both TGFB2 ligand and TGFBR2 receptor in astrocytes suggests autocrine TGF-β signaling loops that maintain reactive states and promote neuroprotective functions[34][51][66].\n\nIGFBP7 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7) functions as an IGF-binding protein that regulates bioavailability of insulin-like growth factors[34][51]. IGFBP7 upregulation in astrocytes may limit local IGF signaling while simultaneously promoting IGF-independent functions of IGFBP7 itself, including effects on cell adhesion and migration[34][51]. The temporal dynamics of IGFBP7 expression in astrocytes reflect modulation of growth factor signaling across reactive phases.\n\nPDGFRA-associated signaling, while not directly represented through PDGFRA in the gene list, becomes modulated through downstream effectors and regulatory proteins[34][51][59]. Astrocyte responsiveness to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) undergoes dynamic changes during reactive transformation, with initial increases in proliferation driven by growth factor signaling[34][51].\n\n## Cell Cycle Regulation and Proliferation Control\n\nThe proliferation program encompasses multiple layers of cell cycle control, including cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, positive regulators of cell cycle progression, and checkpoint control mechanisms. While classical cell cycle genes including cyclins and CDKs do not appear prominently in the current list, multiple negative regulators and checkpoint control genes are represented.\n\nCDKN1A (p21, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A), while not explicitly listed, represents a critical cell cycle inhibitor frequently induced in response to stress signals; related checkpoint regulators may be represented through other genes[34][51]. The presence of GADD45A and GADD45B (growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 alpha and beta) reflects checkpoint control mechanisms activated in response to DNA damage and stress stimuli[3][34][51]. GADD45A and GADD45B induce cell cycle arrest and promote DNA repair, representing stress-responsive mechanisms limiting proliferation during acute injury phases[3][34][51]. Notably, GADD45A and GADD45B show downregulation in chronic TBI astrocytes, suggesting release from cell cycle checkpoints as astrocytes progress toward chronic activated states[34][66].\n\nNR4A3 (nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 3), also known as NOR1, functions as a stress-inducible transcription factor regulating apoptosis and cell cycle responses[34][51]. NR4A3 upregulation accompanies acute inflammatory signaling; however, the temporal dynamics of NR4A3 expression in different reactive phases remain poorly characterized[34][51].\n\n## Astrocytoma-Specific Molecular Alterations and Tumor-Promoting Functions\n\nAstrocytoma represents a spectrum of CNS malignancies ranging from low-grade pilocytic astrocytomas (WHO grade 1) to highly aggressive diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas and glioblastomas (WHO grades 3-4)[37][50][52][59][62]. The molecular basis of astrocytoma encompasses both inherited driver mutations and somatic alterations that distinguish neoplastic transformation from reactive astrocyte phenotypes. While the provided gene list does not include classical astrocytoma drivers (BRAF, TP53, PDGFRA, H3F3A, ATRX), it comprises numerous genes dysregulated in astrocytoma contexts and mediating tumor-promoting functions.\n\nIn pediatric low-grade gliomas, particularly pilocytic astrocytomas, the KIAA1549::BRAF fusion occurs in approximately 80% of cases, resulting in constitutively active BRAF signaling[4][50][62]. Downstream of BRAF, the ERK/MAPK pathway drives proliferation and survival; however, specific MAPK family members within the current gene list remain limited. MAPK4, represented in the list, functions as a mitogen-activated protein kinase involved in stress response signaling; its role in astrocytoma contexts remains incompletely characterized[34][51][66].\n\nPediatric high-grade gliomas exhibit more complex molecular landscapes, with alterations in TP53, H3F3A (histone H3 variant 3 family member A), ATRX, PDGFRA, and PIK3CA occurring in various combinations[37][50][52][59][62]. These driver mutations establish permissive contexts for additional alterations; transcriptomic programs within astrocytoma cells reflect both intrinsic driver mutations and responses to the tumor microenvironment[37][50][52][59][62].\n\nThe tumor microenvironment program encompasses genes mediating astrocytoma cells' interactions with non-neoplastic cellular components including infiltrating immune cells, vasculature, and normal brain parenchyma. FN1, COL4A1, COL4A2, and other ECM proteins constitute major constituents of the tumor microenvironment, where they promote invasion, angiogenesis, and immune cell infiltration[67]. PDPN (podoplanin), represented in the gene list, functions as a lymph vessel endothelial hyaluronic acid receptor 1 (LYVE-1)-binding molecule promoting lymphangiogenesis and immune cell trafficking[67]. The upregulation of PDPN in astrocytoma and other gliomas facilitates immune cell extravasation and infiltration of the tumor microenvironment[67].\n\nImmunosuppressive functions represent hallmark features of astrocytoma microenvironments, achieved through multiple mechanisms including secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines, expression of inhibitory checkpoint ligands, and recruitment of immunosuppressive myeloid cells[67][69]. While classical checkpoint inhibitors (PD-L1/CD274, CTLA-4 ligands) do not appear in the current list, multiple genes mediating immunosuppression do. IL6R engagement by astrocytoma-derived IL-6, in conjunction with soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), activates trans-signaling on immune cells that promotes IL-6-mediated immunosuppression[34][51][67]. The presence of IL6R in the gene list reflects this aspect of the immunosuppressive microenvironment[67].\n\n## Apoptosis Regulation and Cell Death Control Programs\n\nAstrocytomas and reactive astrocytes exhibit altered expression of apoptosis regulatory genes that tip the balance toward cell survival, enabling proliferation and persistence despite stress conditions. BCL6 and related BCL2 family members regulate intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathways through complex interactions between pro-survival (BCL2, MCL1) and pro-apoptotic (BAX, BAK, BID) family members. While classical BCL2 does not appear in the list, MCL1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1) functions as a critical anti-apoptotic factor whose upregulation promotes tumor cell survival[31][34][51][66].\n\nFAS (Fas cell surface death receptor) mediates extrinsic apoptotic signaling through engagement of FasL, activating caspase-8 and downstream caspase cascades[32][57]. FAS expression modulation in astrocytomas affects sensitivity to Fas ligand-mediated death signals from immune cells[34][51][67]. The downregulation of FAS expression in astrocytoma contexts may reduce astrocytoma cell sensitivity to immune-mediated killing, contributing to immune evasion[34][51][67].\n\nProtein kinase C-theta (PRKCQ) and related stress-responsive kinases regulate NF-kappaB signaling and cell survival responses; however, PKC family members do not appear prominently in the current list[34][51]. ATF3, previously discussed in transcriptional regulation contexts, simultaneously functions as a regulator of apoptotic responses, with context-dependent pro- or anti-apoptotic functions depending on target gene contexts[34][51].\n\n## Cell Adhesion and Extracellular Matrix Interactions\n\nThe cell adhesion program encompasses integrin-ligand interactions, cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, and immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecules that mediate astrocyte-ECM interactions and astrocyte-neuron contacts. ITGA3 (integrin subunit alpha 3), representing integrin α3β1 complexes, binds primarily to laminin and collagen, mediating astrocyte adhesion to basement membranes and ECM components[34][51][67]. Integrin-mediated signaling through focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src family kinases generates signals promoting cell migration, proliferation, and survival[34][51][66][67].\n\nITGAV (integrin subunit alpha V), functioning primarily in αVβ3 and αVβ5 integrin complexes, binds to multiple ECM ligands including fibronectin, vitronectin, and thrombospondin[34][51][67]. ITGAV upregulation in reactive astrocytes and astrocytoma cells increases adhesion to ECM components and enhances migratory capacity[34][51][67]. The dysregulation of integrin signaling in astrocytoma contributes to invasion and metastatic potential[34][51][67].\n\nCDH11 (cadherin 11), also known as osteoblast-cadherin, mediates homophilic cell-cell adhesion and functions distinctly from the classical epithelial cadherins (CDH1/E-cadherin)[34][51][67]. CDH11 upregulation in astrocytoma contexts mediates astrocyte-astrocyte adhesion and contributes to maintenance of cellular aggregates within the tumor microenvironment[34][51][67]. The switch from CDH1 to CDH11 expression represents a hallmark of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like processes in gliomas[34][51][67].\n\n## Chemokine and Cytokine Signaling Networks\n\nChemokines represent critical mediators of immune cell recruitment and orchestration of neuroinflammatory responses. CCL2, previously emphasized in the neuroinflammatory program, functions as the primary chemokine recruiting monocytes and macrophages into brain parenchyma[3][28][34][51][67]. CCL2 upregulation in astrocytes drives Iba1+ microglial accumulation and CD11b+ myeloid cell infiltration, reshaping the cellular composition of the local immune microenvironment[3][28][34][51].\n\nCXCL2 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 2) functions as an additional neutrophil-attracting chemokine whose upregulation in reactive astrocytes may facilitate neutrophil infiltration during acute inflammatory phases[34][51][67]. The temporal dynamics of CXCL2 expression remain incompletely characterized in astrocyte activation models, though its inclusion suggests roles in immune cell recruitment during specific reactive phases.\n\nIL1R1 and IL1RAP, previously discussed, constitute the receptor apparatus for IL-1 signaling, enabling response to both IL-1α and IL-1β produced by astrocytes themselves and by infiltrating immune cells[3][34][51]. IL-1 signaling through IL1R1/IL1RAP complexes activates MyD88-dependent NF-kappaB and MAPK cascades, amplifying pro-inflammatory gene expression[3][28][34][51][66]. The presence of both ligand-responsive IL1R1 and adaptors (IL1RAP) in the gene list indicates robust IL-1 signaling capacity in activated astrocytes.\n\nIL6R (interleukin-6 receptor alpha), representing both membrane-bound and soluble forms, functions in classical IL-6 signaling on astrocytes themselves as well as in trans-signaling on immune cells[3][34][51][67]. IL-6 trans-signaling, occurring through soluble IL-6R, particularly promotes immunosuppressive IL-10 and TGF-β production in immune cells, contributing to immunosuppressive astrocytoma microenvironments[34][51][67].\n\n## Astrocyte-Derived Extracellular Vesicles and Secreted Mediators\n\nBeyond traditional secreted proteins, astrocytes release extracellular vesicles (exosomes, microvesicles) containing proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that mediate intercellular communication. While vesicle biogenesis and trafficking genes do not appear prominently in the current list, several represented genes encode proteins enriched in astrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles. ANXA2 (annexin A2), present in the gene list, localizes to plasma membranes and extracellular vesicles, mediating membrane trafficking and potentially participating in extracellular vesicle release[34][51][66]. ANXA2 upregulation in astrocytes may enhance astrocyte-derived microvesicle release and intercellular communication capacity.\n\nVMP1 (vacuole membrane protein 1) functions in vesicle trafficking and potentially in autophagy-related processes; its upregulation in astrocytes may indicate enhanced vesicular trafficking supporting increased secretion of inflammatory mediators and ECM proteins[34][51][66]. CADPS (Ca2+-dependent secretion activator), while not prominently represented in current literature regarding astrocyte functions, encodes a protein regulating secretory vesicle priming and release, suggesting participation in enhanced secretory capacity of activated astrocytes[34][51].\n\n## Metabolic Substrate Utilization and Energetic Adaptation\n\nBeyond glycolysis, astrocytes undergo rewiring of amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism pathways supporting both energy generation and biosynthesis of lipid mediators and proteins. ELOVL5 (ELOVL fatty acid elongase 5) participates in long-chain fatty acid elongation, potentially contributing to synthesis of lipid mediators and membrane components required for astrocyte proliferation and morphological reorganization[34][51][66]. ELOVL5 upregulation in astrocytes may reflect demands for increased lipid biosynthesis accompanying membrane trafficking and vesicular secretion.\n\nSAT1 (spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1) catalyzes catabolism of polyamines, which are critical for cell proliferation, differentiation, and inflammatory responses[34][51][66]. SAT1 upregulation in astrocytes may reflect increased polyamine turnover supporting rapid proliferation and inflammatory gene expression[34][51][66]. The relationship between SAT1 expression and astrocyte proliferation dynamics warrants further investigation.\n\n## Neuroprotection and Cellular Repair Programs\n\nWhile reactive astrocytes often exhibit pro-inflammatory phenotypes that may exacerbate neuronal injury, they simultaneously express multiple neuroprotective factors supporting neuronal survival, plasticity, and recovery. BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), while not explicitly listed in the current gene list, functions as a critical neuroprotrophic factor; however, related neurotrophic signaling may be represented through other genes[45][51][66]. The upregulation of CLCF1, discussed in the synaptic interaction program, represents astrocyte-mediated neuroprotection through cytokine signaling[3][34][51].\n\nDEC1 (deleted in esophageal cancer 1), also known as BHLHE40, functions as a transcriptional regulator involved in circadian rhythm control and metabolism; its roles in astrocyte neuroprotection remain to be characterized[34][51]. NOS1AP (nitric oxide synthase 1 adapting protein), representing an adaptor protein for neuronal NOS (nNOS), may participate in regulating neuronal nitric oxide signaling; however, direct astrocyte functions remain incompletely understood[34][51][66].\n\nEDNRA (endothelin receptor type A) mediates endothelin-1 signaling, which modulates astrocyte contractility and influences blood flow and neurovascular coupling[34][51][66]. The regulation of EDNRA expression in astrocytes affects their capacity to influence cerebral blood flow and brain metabolic homeostasis.\n\n## Temporal Dynamics of Gene Program Activation Across Reactive Phases\n\nCritical insights into gene program organization emerge from temporal analysis across multiple reactive phases. Acute phase (0-2 days post-injury) astrocytes display robust pro-inflammatory gene expression with prominent upregulation of TNF, CCL2, IL-1, cytokine receptors, complement components, and immediate early transcription factors[3][7][28][34][66]. This acute neuroinflammatory signature aims to clear cellular debris, contain injury, and recruit immune responses[3][28][34][66].\n\nSubacute phase (1-2 weeks post-injury) astrocytes show selective downregulation of many acute inflammatory genes, with TNF, Ccl2, Cxcl10, Il1b, and Stat3 no longer differentially expressed or expressed at substantially reduced levels compared to sham controls[3][34][66]. Simultaneously, genes mediating synapse pruning (SPARC, C1Q components), matrix remodeling, and early neurodegeneration-associated processes demonstrate selective upregulation[34][51][66]. This transcriptional transition reflects astrocytes' progression from acute inflammation toward chronic neurodegeneration[34][43][66].\n\nChronic phase (6-12 months post-injury) astrocytes maintain activation while expressing complex, temporally distinct gene signatures incorporating both pro-inflammatory and neuroprotective genes[34][43][51][66]. Notably, genes including APP (amyloid precursor protein), APOE, and NCSTN (nicastrin) demonstrate prominent upregulation in chronic phases, reflecting astrocytic participation in amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition and potentially driving long-term neurodegeneration[34][43][51][66]. Simultaneously, neuroprotective genes including SOD1, CRYAB (crystallin alpha B), and BDNF remain elevated, indicating concurrent neurotoxic and neuroprotective programs[34][43][51][66].\n\nThe temporal dynamics of gene program activation establish a framework for understanding how acute protective responses may transition toward chronic neurodegenerative contributions if not adequately resolved. This chronobiological perspective emphasizes that astrocyte reactivity represents not a single discrete state but rather a dynamic continuum of transcriptional and phenotypic changes unfolding across hours, days, weeks, and months[34][43][51][66].\n\n## Astrocytic Microenvironmental Remodeling in Astrocytoma\n\nThe ECM composition within astrocytoma microenvironments exhibits profound dysregulation compared to normal brain, with altered collagen, fibronectin, laminin, and proteoglycan ratios[67]. This ECM remodeling promotes astrocytoma cell invasiveness while simultaneously creating immune-suppressive microenvironments by sequestering chemokines and presenting ligands for inhibitory immune receptors[67]. The ECM remodeling program genes represented in the current list (FN1, COL4A1, COL4A2, COL8A1, ADAMTS9, TIMP3) collectively drive the profound microenvironmental transformation characteristic of astrocytoma[34][51][67].\n\nWithin the astrocytoma microenvironment, vascular endothelial cells express elevated levels of FN1, COL4A1, and other ECM components, creating a pro-angiogenic, immunosuppressive vascular niche[67]. Microglia and infiltrating macrophages within astrocytomas express distinctive ECM proteins including distinctive versican and perlecan isoforms that promote macrophage retention and immunosuppressive polarization[67]. This spatially organized ECM heterogeneity represents an emerging therapeutic target for disrupting astrocytoma-promoting microenvironments[67].\n\n## Conclusion: Integrated Gene Program Architecture in Astrocyte Reactivity and Astrocytoma Pathogenesis\n\nThe comprehensive gene list analysis reveals ten integrated gene programs operating across inflammatory signaling, metabolic adaptation, cytoskeletal reorganization, ECM remodeling, and tumor-promoting functions that collectively define reactive astrocyte phenotypes and astrocytoma-specific molecular alterations. These programs operate not as independent modules but rather as interconnected networks wherein transcriptional regulators coordinate multiple functional programs, metabolic substrates support inflammatory and biosynthetic processes, and cytoskeletal reorganization enables both cell migration and changes in morphology required for specific functions[3][7][28][34][43][51][66]. The strong representation of immediate early genes (EGR1, JUN, JUNB, FOS, FOSL2, ATF3), pan-reactive astrocyte markers (GFAP, CD44, SERPINA3, CHI3L1), and inflammatory mediators (CCL2, IL6R, IL1R1, IL1RAP, STAT3) indicates that the gene list captures core reactive astrocyte biology highly conserved across injury contexts and disease states. Complementary representation of ECM remodeling genes, metabolic enzymes, and growth factor signaling mediators extends beyond canonical inflammatory responses to encompass the multifaceted nature of astrocyte contributions to brain microenvironment organization and disease pathogenesis. These findings establish a systems-level framework for understanding how single-gene alterations in driver mutations (BRAF, TP53, PDGFRA in astrocytoma) become amplified through multiple gene program interactions to establish irreversible malignant transformation. Future therapeutic strategies may leverage this integrated gene program framework to specifically modulate reactive astrocyte phenotypes while preserving neuroprotective functions.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"cell_type\": \"Astrocytes\",\n    \"disease\": \"Astrocytoma (ranging from pilocytic astrocytoma WHO grade 1 to high-grade astrocytoma/glioblastoma WHO grades 3-4)\",\n    \"tissue\": \"Brain; central nervous system\"\n  },\n  \"input_genes\": [\n    \"TNC\", \"CD44\", \"VCL\", \"SAMD4A\", \"IGFBP7\", \"DEC1\", \"ELL2\", \"CADPS\", \"ACTN1\", \"GBP2\",\n    \"BCL6\", \"GLIS3\", \"EMP1\", \"SERPINA3\", \"NAMPT\", \"TPST1\", \"GAP43\", \"NEAT1\", \"SPOCD1\", \"GFAP\",\n    \"MAP3K14\", \"FN1\", \"CLIC4\", \"PDE8B\", \"MAP1B\", \"TENM4\", \"SOD2\", \"SORBS1\", \"ANXA2\", \"VMP1\",\n    \"PGM2L1\", \"SERPINE1\", \"FOSL2\", \"ZFP36\", \"WWTR1\", \"GADD45A\", \"CCN1\", \"CNN3\", \"HAS2\", \"F3\",\n    \"RASD1\", \"PRRX1\", \"BAALC\", \"TCIM\", \"LYST\", \"RFTN1\", \"FRMD5\", \"GBP1\", \"MAN1C1\", \"NRP2\",\n    \"TIMP3\", \"HRH1\", \"ZFP36L2\", \"YBX3\", \"CCL2\", \"GLUL\", \"PFKFB3\", \"JUNB\", \"MAPK4\", \"CDH11\",\n    \"DCLK1\", \"SPRED1\", \"NEDD9\", \"SAT1\", \"LPAR1\", \"LMO2\", \"ARID5B\", \"ARHGEF3\", \"STAT3\", \"ETV6\",\n    \"LMCD1\", \"DTNA\", \"BTBD11\", \"ARHGAP29\", \"GEM\", \"FOS\", \"TGFB2\", \"CLU\", \"KLF6\", \"COL4A1\",\n    \"PALLD\", \"CAMK2D\", \"TPM4\", \"TIPARP\", \"GADD45B\", \"UBASH3B\", \"TRIO\", \"NAV2\", \"ITPKB\", \"PRUNE2\",\n    \"EGR1\", \"CLCF1\", \"IFI16\", \"MYOF\", \"DPYD\", \"ABCC3\", \"CHI3L1\", \"NRCAM\", \"SOCS3\", \"NIBAN1\",\n    \"RNF19A\", \"LINC02821\", \"COL8A1\", \"A2M\", \"NFATC2\", \"MIR4435-2HG\", \"ARID5A\", \"PITPNC1\", \"NR4A3\", \"CLIP1\",\n    \"NOS1AP\", \"CEBPD\", \"PLSCR1\", \"PMP2\", \"ATF3\", \"NUDT4\", \"OSMR\", \"CNR1\", \"C1R\", \"RDH10\",\n    \"PROS1\", \"RETREG1\", \"RPE65\", \"SLC39A14\", \"FNDC3B\", \"ANO6\", \"TANC1\", \"IQGAP2\", \"IL6R\", \"FOSB\",\n    \"IL1RAP\", \"ITPR2\", \"ADAMTS9\", \"FBXO32\", \"ITGAV\", \"IL1R1\", \"VIM\", \"SPARCL1\", \"SLC44A3\", \"KLF7\",\n    \"TGFBR2\", \"ZNF385D\", \"ELMOD1\", \"JUN\", \"GPR158\", \"MARCH3\", \"AC092131.1\", \"EFEMP1\", \"EDNRA\", \"AC092691.1\",\n    \"P3H2\", \"CITED1\", \"C11ORF96\", \"GALNT2\", \"RCAN1\", \"ITPKC\", \"COL4A2\", \"GPC6\", \"C3\", \"CNTNAP3B\",\n    \"RDH10-AS1\", \"ADAM12\", \"CHL1\", \"BTG2\", \"GALNT15\", \"NFIL3\", \"MYO1E\", \"DUSP1\", \"IFFO2\", \"PHLDB2\",\n    \"SCARA3\", \"CYTOR\", \"AL596087.2\", \"BAALC-AS1\", \"FAM20C\", \"NNMT\", \"STK40\", \"LINC01138\", \"SULF1\", \"FMN2\",\n    \"CFI\", \"PDPN\", \"IRS2\", \"HIF1A\", \"ID1\", \"HLA-E\", \"ITGA3\", \"DOK5\", \"PDLIM5\", \"CXCL2\",\n    \"MRTFB\", \"DPYD-AS1\", \"MFHAS1\", \"MCL1\", \"EGR3\", \"ELOVL5\", \"LTF\", \"CRISPLD1\", \"GFPT2\", \"LINC00698\"\n  ],\n  \"programs\": [\n    {\n      \"program_name\": \"Acute Neuroinflammatory Activation\",\n      \"description\": \"Rapid pro-inflammatory gene expression program characterized by upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and immune signaling molecules within 2 days of astrocyte activation.

Multiple spatial transcriptomic studies demonstrate heterogeneous ECM and immune cell distribution within astrocytoma microenvironments, with differential expression patterns in vascular endothelium, microglia, and macrophages.\",\n      \"significance_score\": 0.85,\n      \"citations\": [\n        {\"source_id\": \"4\", \"notes\": \"BRAF-driven CCL2 and microglia recruitment\"},\n        {\"source_id\": \"34\", \"notes\": \"IL-6 trans-signaling immunosuppression\"},\n        {\"source_id\": \"67\", \"notes\": \"Single-cell spatial mapping of ECM in glioma\"},\n        {\"source_id\": \"69\", \"notes\": \"Immune cell dynamics in peritumoral cortex\"}\n      ],\n      \"supporting_genes\": [\"CCL2\", \"CXCL2\", \"IL6R\", \"IL1RAP\", \"TGFB2\", \"TGFBR2\", \"FN1\", \"COL4A1\", \"COL4A2\", \"PDPN\"],\n      \"required_genes_not_in_input\": {\n        \"genes\": [\"CSF1\", \"VEGFA\", \"VEGFC\", \"ANGPT1\", \"ANGPT2\", \"IL10\", \"ICAM1\", \"VCAM1\"],\n        \"citations\": [\n          {\"source_id\": \"4\", \"notes\": \"CSF1 in microglia recruitment\"},\n          {\"source_id\": \"67\", \"notes\": \"VEGFA/VEGFC in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis\"},\n          {\"source_id\": \"69\", \"notes\": \"Additional immunosuppressive mediators\"}\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"method\": {\n    \"clustering_basis\": [\n      \"Functional literature analysis based on comprehensive recent transcriptomic studies in astrocyte activation (TBI models, 2025)\",\n      \"Integration of astrocytoma-specific molecular alterations from pediatric glioma genomic studies\",\n      \"Pathway database cross-reference (GO terms, Reactome pathways)\",\n      \"Temporal transcriptomic analysis across reactive phases (acute, subacute, chronic)\",\n      \"Single-cell spatial transcriptomic mapping of glioma microenvironments\"\n    ],\n    \"notes\": \"Gene programs identified through integration of multiple biological contexts and temporal dynamics.

This program demonstrates maximal expression at 2 days post-injury with robust upregulation of TNF, CCL2, IL-6, and IFN-γ signaling pathways. The program is mediated by STAT3-dependent transcriptional responses to IL-6 and IL-1 signaling.

Vimentin (VIM), the major intermediate filament of astrocytes, demonstrates robust upregulation following activation and directly correlates with acquisition of pro-inflammatory and pro-migratory phenotypes. Vinculin (VCL) upregulation supports focal adhesion assembly and mechanotransduction. Alpha-actinin proteins (ACTN1) crosslink actin filaments and enable rapid morphological remodeling. The program demonstrates functional integration with adhesion molecule expression (ITGA3, ITGAV, CD44) enabling astrocyte interaction with ECM components. Enhanced expression of Rho family GTPase activators (TRIO, ARHGEF3) coordinates migration signaling with cytoskeletal dynamics. Multiple lines of evidence from reactive astrocyte models and astrocytoma contexts confirm that this program enables both normal reactive astrocyte responses and tumor-promoting invasive phenotypes.",

GFAP represents the most widely used marker of both basal astrocyte identity and reactive transformation, with upregulation commencing within hours of CNS injury and persisting through chronic phases. CD44 upregulation accompanies acquisition of invasive and stemness-associated phenotypes in astrocytes. SERPINA3 demonstrates particular prominence as a dual-function marker correlating with both acute inflammation and neuroprotective functions. CHI3L1 (YKL-40) elevation predicts disease progression in multiple neuroinflammatory conditions. While these markers reliably indicate astrocyte reactivity, they demonstrate limited capacity to distinguish between pro-inflammatory and neuroprotective astrocyte phenotypes without additional gene expression context.",

        "evidence_summary": "The metabolic reprogramming program comprises glycolytic enzymes (PFKFB3), amino acid metabolic enzymes (GLUL), NAD+ biosynthetic pathways (NAMPT), polyamine metabolism (SAT1), and lipid biosynthetic enzymes (ELOVL5). PFKFB3 upregulation in reactive astrocytes catalyzes synthesis of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, a potent allosteric activator of phosphofructokinase that promotes glycolytic flux. GLUL upregulation increases glutamate production, simultaneously supporting excitatory neurotransmission and providing glutamate for immune cell metabolism. NAMPT catalyzes the rate-limiting step in NAD+ biosynthesis, supporting NAD+-dependent SIRT1 signaling for stress resistance. The program demonstrates temporal evolution with enhancement of both glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation pathways in chronic phases. This metabolic shift parallels classical immune cell activation patterns, indicating convergent metabolic rewiring between astrocytes and professional immune cells during inflammatory responses.",

These genes show selective upregulation in subacute injury phases (2 weeks post-injury) coinciding with active synaptic remodeling and refinement. NRCAM downregulation in acute phases correlates with synapse elimination, while selective re-expression in subacute and chronic phases indicates dynamic modulation of astrocyte-neuron interactions. CLCF1 promotes neuroprotective signaling through CNTFR engagement on neurons. The temporal pattern of synapse pruning program activation follows resolution of acute neuroinflammation, suggesting coordinated transition from acute inflammation toward chronic neurodegeneration. While astrocyte-mediated synaptic pruning supports normal brain development and activity-dependent plasticity, dysregulation of this program may contribute to long-term cognitive and functional deficits in TBI and other CNS disorders.",

The temporal dynamics of transcription factor expression establish sequential waves enabling transition from acute inflammation toward chronic neurodegeneration.

TGFB2 upregulation in astrocytes establishes autocrine TGF-β signaling loops that maintain reactive states. TGFBR2 upregulation enhances astrocyte responsiveness to both autocrine TGFB2 and paracrine TGF-β from other sources. IGFBP7 modulation of IGF bioavailability suggests selective regulation of growth factor signaling intensity. GADD45A and GADD45B demonstrate downregulation in chronic phases as astrocytes release from cell cycle checkpoints. The temporal dynamics of this program correlate with progressive increases in astrocyte proliferation from acute phases through subacute and chronic phases, with checkpoint relaxation enabling sustained expansion of astrocyte populations. The program demonstrates integration with transcriptional control networks, whereby growth factor signaling through SMAD-dependent pathways coordinates with AP-1 and STAT3 signaling to establish specific astrocyte phenotypes.",

CDH11 upregulation correlates with EMT-like transitions and enhanced invasive capacity. CD44 upregulation accompanies acquisition of stemness and invasive phenotypes. Vinculin (VCL) links integrins to actin, enabling mechanotransduction and rapid morphological responses. Migration regulators including TRIO, ARHGEF3, and SORBS1 coordinate Rho family GTPase signaling with cytoskeletal dynamics.

CCL2 upregulation recruits infiltrating macrophages and microglia, reshaping the cellular composition of the tumor microenvironment. IL-6 trans-signaling through soluble IL-6R particularly promotes immunosuppressive IL-10 and TGF-β production in immune cells, creating immunosuppressive microenvironments. PDPN upregulation facilitates lymphangiogenesis and immune cell infiltration. ECM remodeling creates invasion-promoting and growth-supporting niches. The program demonstrates enhanced expression in high-grade astrocytomas and glioblastomas relative to low-grade gliomas, indicating particular relevance to malignant progression. Notably, BRAF fusion mutations common in pilocytic astrocytomas drive CCL2 expression through NFkappaB-mediated mechanisms, establishing causative links between driver mutations and microenvironmental remodeling. Multiple spatial transcriptomic studies demonstrate heterogeneous ECM and immune cell distribution within astrocytoma microenvironments, with differential expression patterns in vascular endothelium, microglia, and macrophages.",
