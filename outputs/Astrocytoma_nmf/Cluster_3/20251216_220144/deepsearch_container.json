Through integration of functional genomics, developmental biology, and tumor-specific pathways, we identify eleven distinct gene programs operating across cell adhesion, neuronal differentiation, growth factor signaling, cytoskeletal dynamics, and metabolic regulation. Key findings reveal that coordinated dysregulation of adhesion molecules, ion channel networks, and kinase-phosphatase signaling cascades collectively underlies the shift from normal astrocyte physiology toward malignant transformation. Notably, programs governing neuronal progenitor states, mediated by transcription factors including SOX2 and INSM1, emerge as central drivers of functional plasticity in astrocytic tumors, consistent with recent evidence that glioblastoma cells exploit developmental programs for tumor maintenance and progression.\n\n## Adhesion and Junction Organization Programs\n\nThe transition from normal astrocyte physiology to astrocytic neoplasia involves profound reorganization of cell-cell adhesive contacts. Multiple genes within the input list encode adhesion molecules that coordinate the structural integrity of astrocytic networks and, when dysregulated, facilitate epithelial-to-mesenchymal-like transitions and invasion. The cadherin-catenin complex represents a central nexus of adhesion-dependent signaling in astrocytes, with **CDH2** encoding N-cadherin, a primary adhesion molecule in the developing and mature nervous system[12]. Functional studies demonstrate that loss of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion occurs in low-grade astrocytomas, facilitating a shift toward a more invasive phenotype[12]. The input list includes critical adhesion molecules such as CTNNA3, which encodes α-catenin and serves as a crucial link between cadherins and the actin cytoskeleton, alongside PCDH9, a protocadherin implicated in synaptic organization and cell recognition[59].\n\nCell adhesion molecule (CAM) families including CADM1 participate in homophilic interactions that establish neural tissue architecture. NRCAM, encoding the neuronal cell adhesion molecule, coordinates axonal fasciculation and synaptic plasticity through interactions with its extracellular ligands[59]. In astrocytoma, disrupted adhesion signaling often correlates with enhanced motility and reduced contact inhibition, hallmarks of malignant progression. The ILDR2 gene encodes an immunoglobulin-like domain-containing receptor that may participate in adherens junction stability. Convergent evidence suggests that coordinated downregulation or mutation of multiple adhesion genes drives the loss of epithelial-like properties characteristic of differentiated astrocytes, permitting transition to a more migratory state.\n\nPaxillin-family proteins, including PARD3 and PARD3B, function as molecular scaffolds organizing both adherens junctions and tight junctions through recruitment of polarity complexes[59]. These proteins maintain epithelial integrity through PRICKLE2-mediated interactions; PRICKLE2 acts as a component of the planar cell polarity pathway and influences cell migration through Wnt signaling modulation. In contrast to their normal roles in maintaining astrocyte architecture, dysregulation of PARD3/PARD3B signaling promotes invasive migration characteristic of high-grade astrocytomas. PDZRN3, encoding a PDZ domain-containing ring finger protein, facilitates organization of junctional complexes through interactions with multiple scaffolding proteins.\n\nThe atomic program encompassing cell adhesion includes CDH2, CTNNA3, PCDH9, CADM1, NRCAM, ILDR2, PARD3, PARD3B, PRICKLE2, and PDZRN3, collectively supporting the prediction that dysregulation of adhesion complexes during astrocytoma progression erodes the architectural organization of the normal astrocytic syncytium, permitting enhanced motility, invasion, and reduced contact-dependent growth inhibition.\n\n## Neuronal Ion Channel and Excitatory Signaling Program\n\nAstrocytes maintain critical bidirectional communication with neurons through regulation of extracellular ion homeostasis and neurotransmitter clearance. The excitatory amino acid transporter SLC1A2 (also known as EAAT2 or GLT-1) represents the primary mechanism for glutamate reuptake in the astrocytic syncytium, essential for terminating synaptic transmission and preventing excitotoxicity[33]. Recent evidence indicates that SLC1A2 expression is significantly altered in Down syndrome astrocytes, with enhanced glutamate uptake capacity[30], suggesting that dysregulation of this transporter may occur during pathological states. The input list notably includes multiple glutamate receptor subunits: GRIA1 (AMPA receptor subunit), GRIK3 (kainate receptor), and GRIN2B (NMDA receptor subunit), typically recognized as neuronal molecules but increasingly recognized as playing roles in glial physiology and tumor cell signaling.\n\nVoltage-gated sodium channel SCN1A participates in astrocyte excitability and calcium signaling integration. The KCND3 gene encodes a potassium channel Kv4.3, a component of the A-current responsible for rapid repolarization in excitable cells. In glioma cells, altered expression of ion channels promotes aberrant calcium signaling and enhanced proliferative capacity. NETO2, an auxiliary protein for AMPA and kainate receptors, modulates ion channel trafficking and kinetics[59]. The convergence of multiple ion channel genes within the input list suggests dysregulation of the electrolyte and neurotransmitter homeostasis machinery during astrocytoma transformation, potentially enabling enhanced calcium-dependent proliferation and altered metabolic states.\n\nEPHA3, encoding an Eph receptor tyrosine kinase, integrates with excitatory signaling cascades through interactions with glutamate receptors. EphA3 has been implicated in glioma progression through bidirectional signaling with ephrin ligands[59]. ADCY2, encoding adenylyl cyclase 2, catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic AMP in response to multiple G-protein coupled receptor inputs, integrating neuronal and astrocytic signaling networks. The neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor NTRK3 interfaces with excitatory signaling through ligand-dependent activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase and MAPK pathways, promoting neuronal survival during development but functioning as a fusion oncogene in certain pediatric high-grade gliomas[40].\n\n## Axon Guidance and Neuronal Differentiation Program\n\nThe semaphorin family of axon guidance molecules includes SEMA3A and SEMA3E, which regulate neuronal migration, axonal outgrowth, and synaptic connectivity during development through interactions with neuropilin and plexin receptors[18][21]. SEMA3A suppresses tumor progression via downregulation of Lin28B[18], suggesting that loss of semaphorin signaling may promote astrocytoma malignancy. The extracellular matrix proteases ADAMTS6, ADAMTS9-AS2, and ADAMTS14 remodel the perineuronal matrix, essential for synaptic plasticity and, in tumoral contexts, facilitating matrix degradation and invasion[2]. ADAMTS9-AS2 represents a long non-coding antisense RNA with potential roles in regulating its sense counterpart ADAMTS9.\n\nSULF1 encodes a sulfatase that modulates heparan sulfate proteoglycan structure, thereby controlling growth factor bioavailability and axon guidance molecule signaling[25]. The connective tissue growth factor homologue PLCE1, which encodes phospholipase C epsilon, integrates calcium signaling in response to receptor tyrosine kinase and G-protein coupled receptor activation. NXPH1, encoding neurexophilin-1, serves as a ligand for neurexins, promoting formation of stable synaptic connections through heterophilic trans-synaptic adhesion[59]. NRCAM mentioned previously also participates in axon fasciculation. NTM, encoding neurotrimin, an IgLON family member, promotes neurite outgrowth and maintains neurite stability through homophilic interactions[59].\n\nThe developmental transcription factor SOX2-OT, a long non-coding RNA overlapping SOX2, participates in the maintenance of neural progenitor states and may be dysregulated during the transition toward astrocytic progenitor-like cellular states in tumors. NPAS3, encoding a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, regulates neuronal migration, axonal guidance, and synaptic plasticity during cortical development[25][59], with emerging evidence that intermediate progenitor cell states driven by similar transcriptional networks operate within glioblastoma[3][36].\n\n## Kinase Signaling Cascade Program\n\nMultiple serine-threonine kinases and tyrosine kinases coordinate astrocyte proliferation, migration, and metabolic state transitions. PRKD1 encodes protein kinase D1, which regulates protein secretion, cytoskeletal dynamics, and cellular migration through phosphorylation of targets including myosin light chain kinase and cofilin. PRKD1 integrates downstream of phospholipase C and calcium signaling, with emerging roles in regulating the balance between epithelial and mesenchymal properties[59]. PRKCA, encoding protein kinase C alpha, participates in multiple signaling cascades including those downstream of PDGF receptor activation, which is a critical driver of pediatric high-grade gliomas[6][17].\n\nThe mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase MAP3K14 (also known as NIK) activates non-canonical NF-κB signaling, with potential roles in stromal remodeling and immune regulation within the tumor microenvironment. NUAK1, encoding an AMPK-related kinase, regulates energy metabolism and cell polarity during migration[59]. NEK6, encoding a nima-related kinase, coordinates cell cycle progression and centrosome dynamics[59]. The kinase program collectively enables enhanced proliferative signaling, metabolic adaptation, and phenotypic plasticity characteristic of astrocytic tumors. Recent studies demonstrate that TP53 loss-of-function increases TERT expression during glioblastoma development, enabling replicative immortality[3], though TERT mutations are not present in the input gene list.\n\n## Phosphatase Signaling and Feedback Regulation Program\n\nThe protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor PTPRZ1 maintains a specialized glycosylation signature in brain tissue that controls its catalytic activity, with dysregulation promoting glioma growth[31]. PTPRT, PTPRJ, PTPRG, and PTPN9 encode additional phosphatases that dephosphorylate and inactivate receptor tyrosine kinases, serving as negative feedback regulators of growth factor signaling. PTPRZ1, also called receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase beta/zeta, participates in myelination and oligodendrocyte development but has altered expression patterns in gliomas, where it may either promote or suppress tumorigenesis depending on phosphorylation state and interacting proteins[31]. PTEN, the critical phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate phosphatase, antagonizes PI3K signaling; loss of PTEN expression or mutation occurs in approximately 30-40% of glioblastomas and promotes hyperactivation of AKT-mediated signaling[8]. PTEN mutations cooperate with TP53 and ATRX mutations to block differentiation of neural stem cells via repression of SOX2[3][36].\n\nPhospholipase C enzymes PLCB4, PLCE1, PLCH1, and PLCG2 generate the second messengers inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, driving calcium release and protein kinase C activation respectively[32]. PLD5 encodes phosphatidic acid-generating phospholipase D5, which participates in membrane dynamics and cytoskeletal organization. The coordinated activity of kinases and phosphatases maintains signaling homeostasis; dysregulation of this balance contributes centrally to astrocytoma progression. Notably, PTEN loss removes a critical brake on PI3K/AKT signaling, a pathway frequently hyperactivated in astrocytomas alongside MAPK pathway dysregulation driven by BRAF fusions or PDGFRA mutations[2][6].\n\n## Growth Factor Receptor Signaling Program\n\nPDGFRA, encoding the alpha isoform of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, represents one of the most frequently altered genes in pediatric high-grade gliomas[6][17]. Activating PDGFRA mutations or amplifications drive tumorigenesis independent of additional genetic hits in some contexts, a demonstration of its sufficiency as a driver oncogene in brain tumors[6]. PDGFC and PDGFRL encode alternative ligands and receptors in the PDGF signaling pathway; PDGFRL, a co-receptor, may modulate PDGFRA signaling intensity. TGFBR2, encoding the transforming growth factor beta receptor type 2, participates in both tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting signaling depending on cellular context and downstream effectors[29]. Recent CAR T cell therapy approaches targeting EGFR-positive tumors employ multiplex genetic disruption of TGFBR2 alongside other immunosuppressive barriers to enhance anti-tumor activity in solid tumors[26].\n\nPTH2R, encoding a parathyroid hormone-2 receptor, may participate in calcium-dependent signaling. OSMR, encoding the oncostatin M receptor beta subunit, coordinates cytokine signaling relevant to tumor-stromal interactions. The convergent dysregulation of multiple growth factor pathways, including PDGFRA amplification, BRAF fusion, NF1 loss, and ATRX mutations, characterizes a spectrum of pediatric gliomas with distinct mutational drivers but overlapping phenotypes[2][6]. Notably, comprehensive mouse models reveal that different oncogenic drivers (FGFR1, BRAF, PDGFRA) produce tumor-type-specific patterns of copy number alterations, suggesting that growth factor pathway activation interacts with chromosomal instability in a mutation-specific manner[6].\n\n## Transcriptional Regulation and Chromatin Remodeling Program\n\nETV1 and ETV6 encode members of the ETS family of transcription factors, which regulate genes involved in proliferation, differentiation, and cell migration. ETV6 serves as a constraint on the transcriptional activity of EWS-FLI fusion proteins in Ewing sarcoma[14], with potential analogous roles in regulating fusion-driven gliomas. RFX4 encodes a regulatory factor X box 4 protein participating in transcriptional regulation of developmental genes. ARID5B encodes an AT-rich interaction domain-containing protein implicated in chromatin accessibility and nucleosome positioning[24]. PRDM16, encoding PR domain-containing protein 16, participates in chromatin-mediated transcriptional repression and is involved in developmental fate specification[28]. DPF3, encoding a zinc finger and PHD domain-containing protein, serves as a subunit of histone deacetylase complexes that remove activating histone acetylation marks.\n\nSOX2-OT, the long non-coding RNA antisense to SOX2, participates in maintenance of the neural progenitor state. Evidence indicates that intermediate progenitor cell-like states driven by transcription factor INSM1 are functionally important in glioblastoma pathogenesis[3][36]; INSM1 is highly expressed in human glioblastoma tumors and during cortical development in intermediate progenitor cells[36]. While INSM1 is not directly present in the input gene list, multiple input genes including SOX2-OT, NPAS3, and RFX4 regulate developmental transcriptional programs that establish and maintain progenitor-like states. The transcriptional program collectively enables dysregulation of cell cycle checkpoint genes, suppression of differentiation, and maintenance of self-renewal capacity characteristic of astrocytic tumor stem cells.\n\n## Cytoskeletal Remodeling and Migration Program\n\nCell migration during astrocytoma invasion requires coordinated reorganization of actin and microtubule networks. FMN2 encodes formin 2, an actin nucleator that initiates linear actin filament assembly essential for filopodial protrusions and cell migration. PARD3 and PARD3B encode partitioning-defective homologues that organize polarized distribution of cytoskeletal elements, with PARD3 functioning as a key component of the par polarity complex. DTNA encodes dystrophin, an actin-associated protein that stabilizes the cortical actin cytoskeleton at the plasma membrane. MYO5B, MYO1E, and MYO16 encode myosin motors that power cellular movements and transport along actin filaments. MYBPC1 encodes a myosin-binding protein C that modulates myosin crossbridge cycling kinetics.\n\nPRICKLE2 participates in planar cell polarity signaling, a conserved developmental pathway regulating coordinated cell migration and tissue elongation. The convergence of multiple actin-regulating genes suggests enhanced motility and invasive capacity during astrocytoma progression. Notably, actin-based migration is coupled to phospholipase C activation and calcium signaling, connecting the cytoskeletal program to multiple upstream signaling cascades. DCLK2, encoding a doublecortin-like kinase, participates in microtubule dynamics during neuronal migration; astrocytoma cells frequently exhibit enhanced migration rates and reduced contact inhibition compared to normal astrocytes.\n\n## Synaptic and Neuronal Communication Program\n\nThe input gene list includes multiple components of the synaptosomal proteome, suggesting potential roles in mediating astrocyte-neuron crosstalk or, in the context of astrocytoma, potentially reflecting aberrant adoption of neuronal-like properties by tumor cells. NLGN4X encodes a neuronal member of the neuroligin adhesion molecule family that coordinates trans-synaptic adhesion. NRXN3 encodes neurexin-3, a presynaptic adhesion molecule that binds neuroligins to organize synaptic architecture[59]. GRIN2B and GRIA1 encode subunits of ionotropic glutamate receptors, with established roles in synaptic transmission and activity-dependent plasticity[59]. GRIK3 encodes a kainate receptor subunit involved in fast synaptic transmission.\n\nNTM and NXPH1 participate in synaptic stabilization through homophilic and heterophilic interactions respectively. PCP4 encodes a Purkinje cell protein that associates with the postsynaptic density and may modulate glutamate receptor trafficking. These genes collectively reflect the nervous system context in which astrocytes reside; however, their expression in astrocytic tumors suggests potential acquisition of neuronal-like properties or enhanced expression of genes supporting astrocyte-neuron communication. Evidence increasingly supports the notion that glioblastoma cells exhibit functional plasticity and can adopt intermediate progenitor-like transcriptional states that overlap with both neuronal and glial developmental programs[3][36].\n\n## Long Non-Coding RNA and Regulatory RNA Program\n\nThe input list includes multiple long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs): LINC01993, LINC00511, LINC01122, SOX2-OT, SCN1A-AS1, SOCS2-AS1, and NR2F2-AS1. Long non-coding RNAs serve diverse regulatory roles including chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, and post-transcriptional control of gene expression. NEAT1, encoding a nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript, represents a well-characterized lncRNA that maintains paraspeckle body structure and regulates stress-response gene expression[60]. NEAT1 has been shown to regulate SOX2 expression through interaction with microRNA-132 in glioma[45], connecting lncRNA function to maintenance of glioma stem cell-like properties. GAS5, encoding growth arrest-specific 5, produces a spliced lncRNA that responds to metabolic stress and may suppress proliferation[63]. The regulatory RNA program reflects the emerging appreciation that non-coding RNAs represent crucial nodes in glioma regulatory networks and may explain why coding mutations alone cannot fully account for glioma phenotypes.\n\n## Extracellular Matrix Remodeling and Cell-Stromal Interactions Program\n\nThe extracellular matrix surrounding astrocytes undergoes profound remodeling during glioma progression, both supporting tumor growth and facilitating invasion. A2M, encoding alpha-2-macroglobulin, serves as a general protease inhibitor binding and inactivating multiple proteases, thereby regulating matrix turnover and growth factor bioavailability. ADAMTS6, ADAMTS9-AS2, and ADAMTS14 encode A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motifs family members that cleave versican, aggrecan, and other matrix proteoglycans, thereby driving matrix remodeling essential for cell migration[2]. COL8A1 encodes type VIII collagen, a non-fibrillar collagen found in basement membranes; dysregulation of basement membrane composition facilitates tumor cell invasion.\n\nF3, encoding fibronectin, provides a scaffold for cell migration and integrin-mediated signaling. P3H2 encodes prolyl 3-hydroxylase 2, an enzyme participating in collagen modification and crosslinking. PROS1, encoding protein S, participates in the anticoagulant response and has been implicated in apoptotic cell clearance. MRC2, encoding mannose receptor C type 2, mediates endocytosis of matrix proteins and may participate in tumor-associated inflammation. FHIT, encoding fragile histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein, functions as a tumor suppressor through sensing of accumulated adenosine nucleotides and triggering of apoptosis in response to DNA damage[47]; FHIT expression is frequently lost in human malignancies including gliomas. The matrix remodeling program collectively enables increased angiogenesis, immune infiltration, and invasion capacity characteristic of high-grade astrocytomas.\n\n## Metabolic Flexibility and Energy Homeostasis Program\n\nRecent evidence indicates that glioblastoma cells exhibit metabolic flexibility, dynamically switching between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation to survive therapeutic stress[55]. The mitochondrial protein SUCLG2 interacts with LMNA to regulate oxidative phosphorylation capacity; knockdown of SUCLG2 suppresses glioblastoma proliferation by impairing mitochondrial function and lactate metabolism[52]. HBEGF, a heparin-binding epidermal growth factor, promotes glioblastoma initiation, proliferation, and invasion via EGFR and AXL signaling[49]. AXL encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase participating in both growth factor signaling and immune evasion through interaction with ligand TIM4 expressed by macrophages[34]. PSEN1, encoding presenilin-1, participates in immune responses and cell chemotaxis[49].\n\nLipoprotein lipase and related lipid metabolism genes ACSBG1, ACSS3, and related lipid-modifying enzymes reflect the lipid-rich environment of the central nervous system and potential metabolic rewiring during astrocytoma progression. OXR1, encoding oxidation resistance protein 1, participates in antioxidant responses protecting against reactive oxygen species. PDE4D and PDE1C encode phosphodiesterases that degrade cyclic nucleotides, thereby reducing PKA and Epac signaling intensity. NAMPT, encoding nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, catalyzes the first committed step in NAD+ biosynthesis from nicotinamide, essential for maintaining energy charge and supporting DNA repair processes[49]. The metabolic program reflects the altered energetic demands of rapidly proliferating tumor cells and their adaptation to hostile microenvironmental conditions including hypoxia and nutrient deprivation.\n\n## Conclusion and Integrated Model of Astrocytoma Gene Programs\n\nThe 174-gene input list comprises multiple interconnected functional modules that collectively recapitulate essential features of astrocytoma biology: loss of adhesive constraints permitting invasion and motility; dysregulation of growth factor signaling particularly through PDGFRA, PDGFC, and TGFBR2; adoption of developmentally-programmed neuronal progenitor-like states; metabolic rewiring supporting rapid proliferation; and extensive remodeling of the extracellular matrix facilitating immune infiltration and angiogenesis. Recent high-impact studies demonstrate that canonical glioblastoma mutations (TERT promoter mutations, TP53 loss, PDGFRA activation) collectively promote functional plasticity through interplay with developmental programs[3][36][40]. The transcription factor INSM1, highly expressed in glioblastomas and in intermediate progenitor cells during cortical development[3][36], emerges as a functional nexus coordinating the transition toward a progenitor-like state that sustains tumorigenicity.\n\nThe input gene list prominently features adhesion molecules (CDH2, CTNNA3, PCDH9, CADM1, NRCAM), growth factor receptors (PDGFRA, TGFBR2), kinases (PRKD1, PRKCA, MAP3K14, NUAK1, NEK6), phosphatases (PTPRZ1, PTPRT, PTPRJ, PTEN), and transcriptional regulators (ETV1, ETV6, RFX4, ARID5B, PRDM16) that coordinately enable the malignant transformation of normal astrocytes. Critically, patient-derived models and primary glioblastoma specimens recapitulate these molecular alterations, preserving driver mutations, DNA methylation profiles, and epigenetic landscapes between primary tumors and derived cell lines[2], validating the functional relevance of dysregulated gene programs to actual disease progression.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"cell_type\": \"astrocytes\",\n    \"disease\": \"astrocytoma\",\n    \"tissue\": \"brain\"\n  },\n  \"input_genes\": [\n    \"CFI\", \"SNTG1\", \"PLEKHG1\", \"PRKD1\", \"ETV6\", \"ADAMTS14\", \"SCN1A\", \"EPHA3\", \"SLC1A2\", \"ADCY2\", \"COL8A1\", \"TNIK\", \"LINC01993\", \"TPST1\", \"STOX1\", \"GLI3\", \"GRIA1\", \"GRIK3\", \"GRIN2B\", \"HS3ST3B1\", \"KLHDC8A\", \"LINC00511\", \"LINC01122\", \"IFI16\", \"ILDR2\", \"GALNT17\", \"IMMP2L\", \"KCND3\", \"GAS7\", \"FBXL7\", \"FNDC3B\", \"FMN2\", \"CNTNAP3B\", \"CTNNA3\", \"DCLK2\", \"DOK5\", \"DPF3\", \"DPY19L1\", \"DTNA\", \"EEPD1\", \"ELMOD1\", \"ETV1\", \"F3\", \"FAM126A\", \"LRRTM3\", \"FHIT\", \"FIGN\", \"LRRC4C\", \"A2M\", \"LZTS1\", \"PLCE1\", \"PREX2\", \"PROM1\", \"RFX4\", \"SAMD4A\", \"SCN1A-AS1\", \"SEMA3A\", \"SEMA3E\", \"SETBP1\", \"SIPA1L1\", \"SIPA1L2\", \"SOCS2-AS1\", \"SOX2-OT\", \"STK33\", \"SULF1\", \"TSHZ2\", \"PODXL\", \"PLCB4\", \"MAP3K14\", \"PITPNC1\", \"MCUB\", \"MOXD1\", \"CDH2\", \"MYO5B\", \"NEK6\", \"NPAS3\", \"NR2F2-AS1\", \"NTM\", \"OSMR\", \"P3H2\", \"PARD3B\", \"PCDH9\", \"PDE1C\", \"PDE4B\", \"PDZRN3\", \"MRC2\", \"ZNF385D\", \"ARID5B\", \"AC125613.1\", \"AC002074.1\", \"AL050309.1\", \"AC018616.1\", \"CADM1\", \"AC243829.2\", \"ATRNL1\", \"AC073050.1\", \"AC110023.1\", \"PGM2L1\", \"AC092958.1\", \"PMP22\", \"PMP2\", \"PLSCR1\", \"PLS3\", \"PLPP4\", \"AC103923.1\", \"PGM5\", \"AC109492.1\", \"PLEKHA4\", \"PLD5\", \"PLCH1\", \"PPP1R1C\", \"PLCG2\", \"AC108749.1\", \"PHLDB2\", \"PHLPP1\", \"POT1-AS1\", \"CARMIL1\", \"PRDM16\", \"AC092691.1\", \"RBM20\", \"RAB31\", \"PTPRZ1\", \"PTPRT\", \"PTPRJ\", \"PTPRG\", \"PTPN9\", \"PTN\", \"PTH2R\", \"PTEN\", \"PTCHD1-AS\", \"PTCHD1\", \"PTCH2\", \"PSRC1\", \"PROS1\", \"AC091078.1\", \"AC091646.1\", \"PRKCA\", \"PRKAR2B\", \"PRICKLE2\", \"AC110296.1\", \"PELI2\", \"PDGFRA\", \"PDLIM5\", \"NPSR1\", \"ADAMTS9-AS2\", \"NOX4\", \"NLGN4X\", \"NKAIN3\", \"NHS\", \"NETO2\", \"ADGRA3\", \"NEDD9\", \"NEAT1\", \"NDST3\", \"NCAM2\", \"NAMPT\", \"ADGRL3\", \"MYO3B\", \"MYO1E\", \"MYO16\", \"MYBPC1\", \"MVB12B\", \"MT-CYB\", \"MT-CO3\", \"MT-CO2\", \"NPNT\", \"ADAMTS6\", \"PDGFRL\", \"NR4A3\", \"RELL1\", \"PDGFC\", \"PDE4D\", \"AC116049.2\", \"PCP4\", \"PCGF5\", \"ACSBG1\", \"PARD3\", \"PAPPA2\", \"PAG1\", \"PACRG\", \"ACSS3\", \"OXR1\", \"ADAM23\", \"OSBPL6\", \"NXPH1\", \"NUAK1\", \"NTRK3\", \"ADAM9\", \"NRXN3\", \"NRCAM\", \"RCAN1\", \"RGMA\", \"RETREG1\", \"TMEM178B\", \"TMEM176A\", \"TMEM164\", \"TMEM163\", \"TMEM108\", \"TGFBR2\", \"TENM1\"\n  ],\n  \"programs\": [\n    {\n      \"program_name\": \"Cell Adhesion and Junction Organization\",\n      \"description\": \"Multi-component program regulating cell-cell adhesive contacts through cadherin-catenin complexes, protocadherin-mediated homophilic interactions, and immunoglobulin domain-containing adhesion receptors.

Activating PDGFRA mutations or amplifications drive tumorigenesis independent of additional genetic hits in some contexts, demonstrating its sufficiency as a driver oncogene in brain tumors. PDGFC and PDGFRL encode alternative ligands and co-receptors in the PDGF signaling pathway; PDGFRL may modulate PDGFRA signaling intensity. TGFBR2 participates in both tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting signaling depending on cellular context and downstream effectors. Recent CAR T cell therapy approaches employ multiplex genetic disruption of TGFBR2 alongside other immunosuppressive barriers to enhance anti-tumor activity. The convergent dysregulation of multiple growth factor pathways, including PDGFRA amplification, BRAF fusion, and NF1 loss, characterizes pediatric gliomas.",

INSM1 is highly expressed in human glioblastoma tumors and, during cortical development, in intermediate progenitor cells.
