The analysis reveals that the input genes predominantly encode components of synaptic signaling pathways, cell adhesion molecules, and neuronal identity factors, suggesting that astrocytoma tumors activate or modulate programs normally associated with neuronal development and synaptic function. By synthesizing current literature, we identify eight major gene programs with direct relevance to astrocytoma biology, ranging from fundamental synaptic plasticity mechanisms to tumor-specific metabolic and developmental program integration.\n\n## Neuronal Development and Differentiation Pathways in Astrocytoma Context\n\n### Proneural Transcription Factor Networks and Neural Identity Specification\n\nAstrocytomas, particularly lower-grade variants, frequently display remarkable plasticity in their cellular phenotypes and can express markers associated with neural progenitor cells and differentiated neurons[59]. The input gene list contains several factors that specify and maintain neuronal identity during development, including SOX6, SOX4, SOX2-OT, and OLIG2, which function as master regulators of neural fate specification. SOX6 and SOX4 are particularly important as they regulate transcription of neuronal differentiation genes and suppress alternative fates during neural development. In the context of astrocytoma, these transcription factors may be activated in tumor subpopulations that adopt a neuronal progenitor-like state, as evidenced by studies showing that glioblastoma cells can express intermediate progenitor cell-like transcriptional profiles[59]. The presence of RBPJ in the gene list is notable, as this is a key component of Notch signaling that regulates neural stem cell maintenance and neurogenesis[54]. Recent work has demonstrated that Rbpj deletion promotes neurogenesis in adult brain tissue, suggesting that RBPJ expression in tumor cells may suppress overt neuronal differentiation and maintain progenitor characteristics[54].\n\nThe genes NOVA1 and ELAVL4 encode RNA-binding proteins that regulate alternative splicing and mRNA stability in neurons. NOVA1 specifically controls splicing of genes involved in neuronal function, while ELAVL4 (also known as HuD) stabilizes mRNAs encoding neuronal proteins and neurotrophic factors like BDNF. These genes are typically expressed at high levels during neuronal differentiation and plasticity[41][44]. In astrocytoma, their expression patterns may correlate with the degree of neuronal differentiation or the neuronal progenitor character of tumor cells, influencing the transcriptome stability and therefore cellular phenotype plasticity[59].\n\nSupporting genes in this program include transcription factors and their regulatory partners that coordinate neural specification: SOX6, SOX4, OLIG2, RBPJ, NOVA1, and ELAVL4. The program is reinforced by CREB5, which regulates neuronal gene expression downstream of signaling pathways, and REV3L, involved in error-prone DNA repair and potentially contributing to genomic instability in tumor cells maintaining neural progenitor traits. DLL1 and DLL3 function as Notch ligands that regulate lateral inhibition during neurogenesis, maintaining the balance between progenitor maintenance and neuronal differentiation. In astrocytoma, dysregulation of these factors could shift the equilibrium toward either increased tumor cell proliferation (enhanced progenitor state) or differentiation (reduced proliferation but potentially enhanced invasiveness through neuronal phenotype adoption).\n\n### Glutamatergic and GABAergic Neurotransmitter Signaling Circuits\n\nThe input gene list is remarkably enriched for genes encoding components of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmitter systems. GRIA2, GRIA4, GRIK2, and GRID2 encode different subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPA receptors and kainate receptors), while DPP6, LHFPL3, and NXPH1 encode auxiliary subunits and associated proteins that modulate glutamate receptor trafficking, localization, and function. Recent research has revealed complex roles for glutamate signaling in glioma biology, where glioma cells can release excessive glutamate through altered transporter expression and glutamate synthesis pathways[70]. Tumor cells expressing high levels of these glutamate receptor subunits could maintain calcium-permeable AMPA receptors that elevate intracellular calcium and support proliferation and survival signaling. The presence of GRIA2 is particularly significant, as its inclusion or exclusion in AMPA receptor tetramers determines calcium permeability and trafficking properties[34]. In astrocytoma, GRIA2 expression patterns may vary between differentiated and stem-like tumor cell populations.\n\nGABAergic signaling components are represented by GABRB3, which encodes the beta-3 subunit of GABA-A receptors. GABAergic signaling often exerts inhibitory effects on neuronal activity, but in the context of transformed cells, altered GABAergic tone can support stemness and undifferentiated cell states. Additionally, the genes encoding presynaptic factors like SYN2 (synapsin 2) and postsynaptic scaffolding proteins support the potential for astrocytoma cells to form or participate in synaptic-like structures, particularly along peritumoral neurons where direct neuron-tumor contacts have been documented[70].\n\nThe glutamatergic and GABAergic system program includes GRIA2, GRIA4, GRIK2, GRID2, GABRB3, DPP6, LHFPL3, NXPH1, and supporting regulatory proteins. The significance of this program lies in its potential to explain how astrocytoma cells can influence and be influenced by the local neuronal microenvironment. Glutamate released by tumor cells can activate receptors on peritumoral neurons, promoting aberrant neuronal activity and seizures, while simultaneously supporting tumor cell survival through autocrine mechanisms[70]. The presence of both receptor and auxiliary protein subunits suggests that astrocytoma cells maintain or can rapidly activate functional neurotransmitter signaling, possibly to support tumor cell phenotypic plasticity or to engage in metabolic symbiosis with neurons.\n\n## Synaptic Organization and Cell Adhesion Architecture\n\n### Synaptic Adhesion Molecule Networks and Neural Cell-Cell Communication\n\nSynaptic development and function depend critically on coordinated cell-cell interactions mediated by adhesion molecules. The input gene list contains an extensive collection of these factors, including neurexins (NRXN1), neuroligins (represented through adjacent genomic regions and associated factors), and cadherin family members (CDH2, CDH10, CDH13, CDH20, PCDH15, PCDH11X). Neurexins and neuroligins form a canonical synaptic adhesion system where neurexin extracellular domains on presynaptic terminals interact with neuroligin domains on postsynaptic membranes, clustering synaptic components and stabilizing synaptic contacts[12]. Although not all neuroligins are present in the input list, multiple components of the adhesion cascade are represented, suggesting that astrocytoma cells can express functional synaptic adhesion machinery.\n\nThe presence of NLGN4X (neuroligin 4, X-linked) is particularly notable, as neuroligins are critical for postsynaptic membrane organization and function. Expression of NLGN4X and other adhesion molecules in astrocytoma cells could enable them to form adhesive contacts with peritumoral neurons or with neighboring tumor cells that adopt neuronal-like characteristics[54]. Recent studies using multi-omics profiling of glioblastoma have identified neuronal-like tumor cell subpopulations that express synaptic markers and form contact-dependent interactions with surrounding cells[59][70].\n\nThe cadherins CDH2, CDH10, CDH13, and CDH20 belong to the classical cadherin family and mediate calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. These molecules are typically expressed during development and are frequently dysregulated in cancer. CDH2 (N-cadherin) is particularly important in the context of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal phenotypes. Enhanced N-cadherin expression often correlates with invasive and stem-like properties in gliomas[69]. In contrast, CDH13 and CDH20 are less commonly studied but likely contribute to neural tissue-specific adhesive properties. The inclusion of multiple cadherin family members suggests that astrocytoma cells may dynamically switch between different adhesion modes during development and progression.\n\nCNTN1 (contactin 1) and CNTNAP2 (contactin-associated protein 2) are GPI-anchored or transmembrane proteins that modulate synaptic organization and neuronal migration. CNTN1 acts as a cell-cell adhesion molecule and regulates axonal fasciculation, while CNTNAP2 stabilizes postsynaptic structures and is implicated in both normal development and autism spectrum disorders[9]. The presence of both contactin family members in the input list suggests that astrocytoma cells express machinery for complex cell-cell communication beyond classical synaptic transmission.\n\nAdditional synaptic organization proteins include DLGAP1 (also called PSD-95-associated protein), DLGAP1-AS4 (an antisense RNA transcript potentially regulating DLGAP1), and DLGAP4-related genes. DLGAP proteins are integral components of the postsynaptic density (PSD), where they function as scaffolding proteins linking glutamate receptors to intracellular signaling cascades. Their expression in tumor cells could support the formation of receptor-signaling complexes that promote survival and proliferation signals. ERC2 (ELKS/Rab6-interacting/CAST family member 2) is another scaffold protein with roles in both presynaptic and postsynaptic organization.\n\nThe synaptic adhesion program encompasses NRXN1, NLGN4X, CDH2, CDH10, CDH13, CDH20, PCDH15, PCDH11X, CNTN1, CNTNAP2, CNTN3, DLGAP1, DLGAP1-AS4, and ERC2. This program is particularly relevant to astrocytoma because it directly enables tumor cell interactions with peritumoral neurons. Studies have shown that glioma cells can form functional neuron-tumor synapses that support both tumor cell proliferation and aberrant neuronal activity[70]. The presence of full synaptic adhesion machinery in tumor cells suggests that these interactions are not incidental but may represent an important mechanism for tumor-microenvironment crosstalk and tumor progression.\n\n### Postsynaptic Density Architecture and AMPA Receptor Trafficking\n\nThe postsynaptic density (PSD) is a densely packed protein assembly beneath the postsynaptic membrane that clusters neurotransmitter receptors and initiates signaling cascades. Multiple genes in the input list encode components of this structure, including DLGAP1, DLGAP4, SHANK proteins (represented through related genomic regions), and Homer proteins. The PSD also contains regulatory kinases and phosphatases, including calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (represented through related genes), which phosphorylate postsynaptic proteins and modulate synaptic strength. \n\nLHFPL3 and DPP6 are important auxiliary proteins that regulate AMPA receptor function and trafficking. These proteins can influence the biophysical properties of AMPA receptors and determine whether they are calcium-permeable or calcium-impermeable, a key distinction that affects cellular signaling[34]. The entry of calcium through AMPA receptors can activate numerous signaling cascades that promote proliferation and survival. In tumor cells, selective expression of LHFPL3 and similar auxiliary proteins could create AMPA receptor phenotypes optimized for cell survival signaling.\n\nThe postsynaptic density program includes DLGAP1, LHFPL3, DPP6, NXPH1, CADM2, and associated scaffolding proteins. This program supports the formation of organized postsynaptic structures in tumor cells, enabling rapid signaling in response to glutamate or other neurotransmitters released in the tumor microenvironment. The presence of this program suggests that astrocytoma cells maintain significant synaptic signaling capacity, potentially enabling them to respond to and influence local neural circuits.\n\n## Cellular Adhesion, Migration, and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Programs\n\n### EMT Regulation and Mesenchymal Differentiation\n\nEpithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical process in cancer metastasis and has been extensively characterized in glioblastoma, where it correlates with increased invasiveness, therapy resistance, and poor prognosis[15][16][51]. The input gene list includes ZEB1, a master regulator of EMT that functions as a zinc-finger transcription factor. ZEB1 is dramatically upregulated during EMT and acts as a central hub integrating signals from growth factor pathways (TGFβ, PDGF), hypoxia, and developmental signaling (Wnt, Notch)[15][16]. ZEB1 directly represses epithelial genes like E-cadherins and enhances expression of mesenchymal genes including N-cadherin (CDH2), which is present in the input list.\n\nA recent study demonstrated a critical positive feedback loop between TNS1 (tensin 1) and ZEB1 in lung cancer, where TNS1 stabilizes ZEB1 protein and protects it from proteasomal degradation[15]. While TNS1 is not in the input list, multiple related cytoskeletal regulators are present, including DLGAP1, ERC2, and cytoskeletal remodeling factors. These proteins could similarly contribute to stabilizing ZEB1 or other EMT transcription factors in astrocytoma cells. The presence of CDH2 (N-cadherin) further reinforces the EMT program by promoting cell migration and reducing cell-cell adhesion strength compared to classical epithelial cadherins.\n\nRecent spatial transcriptomic studies of glioblastoma identified distinct mesenchymal cell states (MES I and MES II) that differ in their expression of hypoxia-response genes, stemness factors, and invasion-associated genes[51]. The MES II state is particularly aggressive and is enriched at the tumor invasive margin. The EMT program in the input gene list suggests that astrocytoma cells expressing these genes would adopt mesenchymal characteristics, including reduced contact inhibition, increased migratory capacity, and potential therapy resistance.\n\nThe EMT program includes ZEB1, CDH2, CDH13, CDH20, and associated regulatory proteins. This program is central to understanding astrocytoma progression from confined tumors to invasive, infiltrative lesions. ZEB1 expression in astrocytoma is particularly significant because it directly promotes the invasive phenotype and is associated with poor clinical outcomes[16]. The presence of multiple cadherins suggests that tumor cells may dynamically regulate their adhesive properties through selective expression of different cadherin family members, enabling transitions between collective invasion (high adhesion) and single-cell invasion (low adhesion).\n\n### Integrin Signaling and Focal Adhesion Assembly\n\nIntegrins are heterodimeric cell-surface receptors that mediate cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions and transmit force and chemical signals bidirectionally across the cell membrane. Integrin signaling activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src family kinases, which phosphorylate substrates in the focal adhesion complex, including paxillin, p130Cas, and related proteins. Multiple components of this pathway are represented in the input list, including PIK3R3 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit 3), which integrates with integrin signaling to activate AKT/PKB survival pathways.\n\nSeveral genes in the input list encode proteins that regulate or interact with the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion complex. These include MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2), which stabilizes microtubules and is typically a neuronal marker but can be expressed in some tumor cells; DMD (dystrophin), which links the cytoskeleton to the ECM through dystrophin-associated protein complexes; and various other cytoskeletal regulatory factors. While DMD is most famous for its mutations in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, it also plays roles in cancer cell migration and invasion[62]. FERMT1 (also called kindlin-1) is an integrin-binding protein that promotes integrin activation and focal adhesion assembly, supporting cell migration.\n\nThe integrin and focal adhesion program includes PIK3R3, FERMT1, and cytoskeletal regulatory proteins. This program supports the ability of astrocytoma cells to navigate through brain tissue by forming and dynamically remodeling focal adhesions in response to ECM stiffness and composition. Recent studies of glioblastoma have shown that integrin signaling drives invasion, particularly along vascular structures and at the tumor-brain interface[56]. The presence of multiple integrin signaling components in the input list suggests that astrocytoma cells maintain robust ECM sensing and migration capabilities.\n\n## Metabolic and Developmental Gene Programs\n\n### Metabolic Plasticity and Hypoxic Adaptation\n\nAstrocytomas frequently develop in hypoxic microenvironments where oxygen availability is limited due to inadequate vascular perfusion. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) drive the expression of metabolic genes that support survival under hypoxic conditions. While HIFs themselves are not in the input list, multiple downstream targets are present, including LDLRAD3 and LDLRAD4 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins with domain 3 and 4), which can regulate lipid metabolism and cellular uptake of lipid-based signaling molecules. These genes become critical under hypoxic conditions where metabolic flexibility is essential for tumor cell survival.\n\nThe input list also includes genes related to nucleotide metabolism and DNA repair. REV3L encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase zeta, an error-prone polymerase involved in translesion synthesis and associated with genomic instability and mutation accumulation during tumorigenesis[62]. In the context of astrocytoma, REV3L expression may contribute to the high mutation burden and genetic heterogeneity observed in these tumors. TFDP2 (transcription factor Dp-2) regulates E2F-dependent gene expression and controls the transition through the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint, linking metabolic capacity to proliferation control.\n\nAdditionally, genes related to protein synthesis and degradation are present, including ubiquitin ligase CBLB and related E3 ubiquitin ligases represented through MARCH1 (membrane-associated RING-CH-type finger proteins 1). These proteins regulate protein turnover and can support metabolic plasticity by rapidly adjusting the cellular protein composition in response to changing microenvironmental conditions.\n\nThe metabolic plasticity program includes LDLRAD3, LDLRAD4, REV3L, TFDP2, CBLB, and MARCH1. This program reflects the metabolic demands of astrocytoma cells growing in a hypoxic, nutrient-limited microenvironment. The presence of genes supporting both lipid and nucleotide metabolism, combined with error-prone DNA polymerases and regulatory factors, suggests that astrocytoma cells employ metabolic flexibility and genomic plasticity as key survival strategies.\n\n### Developmental Signaling and Stem Cell Maintenance Programs\n\nSeveral genes in the input list are critical regulators of stem cell identity and developmental signaling. NOTCH pathway components (DLL1, DLL3, MAML2) are particularly important. DLL1 and DLL3 encode Notch ligands that activate Notch signaling in adjacent cells, initiating lateral inhibition during neurogenesis. In cancer stem cells, Notch signaling often maintains undifferentiated states and supports self-renewal. MAML2 is a Notch coactivator that is essential for Notch-driven transcription[40]. The presence of these components suggests that astrocytoma cells can activate Notch signaling to maintain or enhance stemness, contributing to the cancer stem cell population that drives tumor recurrence after therapy.\n\nWNT signaling components are implied through the presence of related factors and WNT-target gene regulators. While canonical Wnt ligands are not directly in the list, downstream factors that integrate Wnt signaling with other pathways are present. For example, CREB5 (cAMP response element binding protein 5) is a transcription factor that cooperates with other signaling pathways to regulate stemness-associated genes. Additionally, genes related to chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation are present, including factors that maintain or reprogram chromatin states associated with stem cell identity.\n\nSOX2-OT is an antisense RNA transcript that regulates SOX2 expression. SOX2 is a critical pluripotency factor and neural stem cell marker. In glioblastoma, SOX2 is frequently maintained at high levels and directly supports stemness, tumor-initiating cell capacity, and therapeutic resistance[59]. While SOX2 itself is not in the input list, the presence of SOX2-OT suggests that the tumor cell program includes regulatory mechanisms for maintaining SOX2 expression.\n\nThe stem cell maintenance program includes DLL1, DLL3, MAML2, SOX2-OT, CREB5, and related chromatin regulatory factors. This program is central to astrocytoma biology because glioblastoma and grade II-III astrocytomas contain populations of cancer stem cells that drive tumor initiation, growth, and recurrence. The presence of Notch pathway components and stemness-associated transcriptional regulators indicates that the tumor cells maintain active mechanisms for self-renewal and undifferentiated state maintenance.\n\n## Growth Factor and Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signaling\n\n### EGFR and Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Pathways in Astrocytoma\n\nEGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) is one of the most frequently altered genes in glioblastoma, with amplification occurring in approximately 45% of cases and mutations in approximately 7% of cases[11]. The presence of EGFR in the input gene list indicates that this gene is part of the integrated program being analyzed. EGFR signaling activates multiple downstream cascades including MAPK/ERK signaling, PI3K/AKT signaling, and JAK/STAT signaling. Each of these pathways promotes tumor cell proliferation, survival, and invasive behavior[2][68]. Recent work has demonstrated that EGFR amplification in classical glioblastomas is associated with specific tumor cell states, including the GPC-like (glial progenitor-like) state that shows enhanced proliferation and stemness[57].\n\nNTRK3 encodes the tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC), a receptor tyrosine kinase for neurotrophins including NT3. NTRK genes are frequently involved in oncogenic translocations in various cancers, including some gliomas. In the input gene list, NTRK3 likely contributes to neurotrophin signaling that supports neuronal differentiation or progenitor cell survival. Interestingly, recent studies identified a novel TRIM24::NTRK2 fusion gene in an epithelioid glioblastoma patient, demonstrating that NTRK fusion proteins can drive aggressive glioma growth[2][68]. The presence of NTRK3 in the list suggests potential involvement in growth factor signaling networks in astrocytoma.\n\nFGF12 and FGF14 encode fibroblast growth factors that activate FGF receptors (FGFRs). FGF signaling is critical during neural development and can promote either neuronal differentiation or progenitor cell maintenance depending on the cellular context and downstream signaling activation. In glioblastoma, FGF signaling often promotes proliferation and can contribute to therapeutic resistance. The presence of multiple FGF family members suggests that astrocytoma cells maintain FGF signaling capacity, potentially responding to FGFs in the tumor microenvironment.\n\nThe growth factor and RTK signaling program includes EGFR, NTRK3, FGF12, FGF14, and downstream signaling mediators. This program is absolutely central to astrocytoma pathobiology because constitutive growth factor receptor signaling drives tumor cell proliferation and survival. The presence of multiple receptor types suggests that astrocytoma cells employ receptor redundancy, where loss of one receptor can be partially compensated by activation of alternative receptors, a key mechanism of intrinsic and acquired therapy resistance[68].\n\n### PDGFRA Signaling and Neural Progenitor-Specific Growth Responses\n\nPDGFRA (platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha) is frequently altered in astrocytoma and other diffuse gliomas. PDGFRA signals through similar downstream cascades as EGFR, promoting proliferation and survival. Additionally, PDGFRA signaling is particularly important in maintaining oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and high-grade gliomas frequently express OPC-like tumor cell states. While PDGFRA itself is not explicitly in the input list, multiple downstream effectors of PDGF signaling are present, including AKT-activating phospholipids, PI3K regulatory subunits, and other mediators[11][27].\n\nThe PDGFRA program, while partially represented in the input list through downstream components, reflects the integration of astrocytoma cells with developmental neural progenitor signaling. High-grade gliomas frequently maintain OPC-like characteristics, which confer increased proliferation rates and stemness properties. The presence of genes supporting this differentiation state suggests that astrocytoma cells can activate and maintain OPC-like phenotypes, contributing to tumor aggressiveness and therapy resistance.\n\n## Extracellular Matrix Remodeling and Protease Activity\n\n### Matrix Metalloproteinase and ADAMTS Family Proteases\n\nThe input gene list includes MMP16 (matrix metalloproteinase 16), which encodes a membrane-anchored metalloproteinase involved in ECM remodeling and cellular migration. ADAMTS6 and ADAMTS19 encode A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motifs proteins that degrade ECM components and regulate angiogenesis and cell migration. These proteases are upregulated in glioblastoma and contribute to tumor invasion and perivascular space formation[35][48]. The presence of multiple protease family members indicates that astrocytoma cells maintain robust ECM degradation capacity, enabling invasion through the brain parenchyma.\n\nAdditionally, SMOC1 (secreted modular calcium-binding protein 1) is present in the input list. While SMOC1 is not itself a protease, it is an ECM-associated protein that interacts with matrix components and can modulate protease activity. SMOC1 is involved in developmental signaling and tissue remodeling. In the context of astrocytoma, SMOC1 may contribute to ECM dynamics and regulate protease activity in the tumor microenvironment.\n\nThe protease and ECM remodeling program includes MMP16, ADAMTS6, ADAMTS19, and SMOC1. This program is critical for astrocytoma invasion because ECM degradation is a fundamental requirement for single-cell invasion through brain tissue. Tumor cells that express high levels of these proteases can breach the blood-brain barrier, infiltrate peritumoral brain tissue, and evade surgical resection by extending into normal tissue beyond the visible tumor boundary[35].\n\n### ECM Composition and Cell-ECM Interaction\n\nVCAN (versican), a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, is present in the input list and is a major component of the ECM. VCAN expression is frequently elevated in glioblastoma and other cancers and promotes invasion and immune suppression[47][50]. The presence of VCAN-AS1 (an antisense transcript of VCAN) suggests that VCAN expression is subject to post-transcriptional regulation in tumor cells. Additionally, COL11A1 (collagen type XI alpha 1) is present in the list; collagen is the most abundant ECM component and provides structural support and mechanical cues for cell migration.\n\nThe ECM composition program includes VCAN, VCAN-AS1, COL11A1, SMOC1, and protease regulators. This program reflects the remodeling of the ECM in the tumor microenvironment, where tumor cells both degrade existing matrix and synthesize new matrix components. In astrocytoma, ECM remodeling supports both tumor cell invasion and immune suppression, as physical alterations in matrix composition can reduce immune cell penetration and trafficking through the tumor[35][56].\n\n## Synaptic Plasticity and Signal Transduction\n\n### Calcium Signaling and Second Messenger Systems\n\nCALCRL encodes calcitonin receptor-like receptor, a G-protein coupled receptor involved in neuropeptide signaling and pain signaling. This receptor can activate second messenger systems including cyclic AMP and calcium signaling. In the context of astrocytoma cells, CALCRL signaling could support survival and proliferation through activation of GPCR-coupled signaling cascades. Similarly, VIPR2 (vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2) encodes another GPCR that regulates both neuronal and immune cell function. Expression of these receptors in tumor cells could enable them to respond to environmental cues like VIP and calcitonin-related peptides.\n\nCASK (calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase) is a fascinating protein that combines the scaffolding activity of MAGUKs with unusual kinase activity[20]. CASK localizes to the membrane through interaction with PDZ domains and phosphorylates substrates recruited to the membrane through its scaffolding activity. In neurons, CASK is part of the postsynaptic density and regulates synaptic transmission. The presence of CASK in astrocytoma cells could support formation of organized signaling complexes that integrate multiple signaling pathways. Additionally, calcium signaling through GRIA2, GRIA4, and other calcium-permeable ion channels can directly elevate intracellular calcium, activating CASK and other calcium-dependent signaling molecules.\n\nThe calcium signaling program includes CALCRL, VIPR2, CASK, and calcium-permeable ion channels (GRIA2, GRIA4, GRID2). This program enables astrocytoma cells to respond to neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in the tumor microenvironment and integrate these signals with intracellular signaling cascades that promote proliferation and survival.\n\n### Src Family Kinase Signaling and Mitochondrial Calcium Regulation\n\nWhile Src itself is not in the input list, multiple substrate proteins for Src-family kinases are present, including ADAM22, DLGAP proteins, and other postsynaptic proteins. Src-family kinases phosphorylate these substrates to regulate synaptic transmission and cell migration. Additionally, genes encoding proteins involved in calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function include SLC8A3 (sodium-calcium exchanger 3), which regulates intracellular calcium levels by exchanging sodium for calcium. SLC8A3 can function in reverse mode to extrude calcium or in forward mode to import calcium, depending on the electrochemical gradients. In tumor cells, SLC8A3 expression could support calcium signaling that promotes survival and proliferation.\n\nThe Src kinase signaling program includes ADAM22, DLGAP1, SLC8A3, and related postsynaptic proteins. This program integrates with growth factor signaling and neurotransmitter signaling to activate downstream proliferation and survival pathways in astrocytoma cells.\n\n## Lipid and Membrane Trafficking Programs\n\n### Lipid Metabolism and Membrane Organization\n\nSERINC5 encodes serine incorporator 5, a protein involved in phosphatidylserine incorporation into membranes. Phosphatidylserine is typically restricted to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, and its exposure on the outer membrane can trigger apoptotic clearance by phagocytes. However, some cancer cells aberrantly expose phosphatidylserine to promote immune evasion or to engage in cell-cell fusion events. SERINC5 regulation of phosphatidylserine distribution could contribute to immune evasion or altered cell-cell interactions in astrocytoma.\n\nAdditionally, BEST3 encodes bestrophin-3, a calcium-activated anion channel involved in calcium signaling and cell volume regulation. In the nervous system, bestrophin channels contribute to astrocyte calcium signaling and gap junction communication[6]. Expression of BEST3 in astrocytoma cells could support altered calcium dynamics and cell-cell communication through gap junctions, potentially enabling synchronization of calcium waves across tumor cell populations.\n\nThe lipid and membrane trafficking program includes SERINC5, BEST3, SLC24A3 (solute carrier family 24), and related genes. This program supports membrane organization, ion homeostasis, and cell-cell communication through membrane proteins in astrocytoma cells.\n\n### Intracellular Trafficking and Endosomal Sorting\n\nRAB27B encodes a small GTPase involved in vesicular trafficking, particularly in the exocytosis of secretory granules and lysosomes. Expression of RAB27B suggests that astrocytoma cells maintain active intracellular trafficking and can secrete signaling molecules and cytokines. Additionally, LUZP2 (leucine zipper protein 2) and related trafficking regulators support the directed movement of vesicles between cellular compartments. Enhanced secretory capacity could enable tumor cells to release growth factors, cytokines, and other signaling molecules that promote tumor growth and immune suppression.\n\nThe intracellular trafficking program includes RAB27B, LUZP2, and related vesicular transport proteins. This program supports the secretory capacity of astrocytoma cells, enabling them to influence the tumor microenvironment through release of growth factors, cytokines, and ECM components.\n\n## Gene Regulatory and Developmental Programs\n\n### Chromatin Remodeling and Transcriptional Plasticity\n\nThe input list includes genes encoding factors involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. KAT2B (lysine acetyltransferase 2B, also known as GCN5) is a histone acetyltransferase that promotes transcription of many genes through histone acetylation. Enhanced histone acetylation at promoters of stem cell genes, growth factors, and invasion-associated genes could promote the tumor cell phenotype. CXXC4 (CXXC finger protein 4) is involved in chromatin remodeling and development. The presence of chromatin remodeling factors reflects the transcriptional plasticity required for astrocytoma cells to adopt different phenotypes (proliferative, invasive, differentiated) in response to microenvironmental signals.\n\n### Epigenetic Regulators and Cell Cycle Control\n\nTFDP2 (transcription factor Dp-2) is involved in E2F-dependent transcription, which controls the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint. E2F-driven genes include cyclins, CDKs, and proteins required for DNA synthesis. The presence of TFDP2 reflects the tight coupling between metabolic capacity and proliferation control in astrocytoma cells. Additionally, RBPJ (recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region) is a key component of Notch signaling and maintains progenitor identity through transcriptional control. As mentioned earlier, Rbpj deletion promotes neurogenesis, suggesting that maintained RBPJ expression in tumor cells supports progenitor maintenance over differentiation[54].\n\n## Microstructural and Developmental Biology Programs\n\n### Axon Guidance, Cell Polarity, and Tissue Architecture\n\nMultiple genes in the input list encode factors involved in axon guidance and cell polarity. These include semaphorins (like SEMA3A, implied through related signals), Robo proteins, and netrins (implied through downstream signaling). Axon guidance molecules typically provide directional cues for axonal outgrowth during development. In the context of astrocytoma, these molecules could direct tumor cell migration along anatomical structures (like white matter tracts or blood vessels) or could disrupt normal neuronal pathways, leading to aberrant neural circuit assembly and seizure activity. Recent work has demonstrated that peritumoral seizure activity correlates with alterations in peritumoral neuronal properties, and astrocytoma-derived molecules can aberrantly activate axon guidance pathways in surrounding neurons[70].\n\nDCX (doublecortin) encodes a microtubule-associated protein involved in neuronal migration during development and in adult neurogenesis. Expression of DCX in tumor cells could support altered microtubule dynamics and cell migration, particularly in developing astrocytomas where developmental signaling pathways may still be partially active. Additionally, MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2) is present in the list; while MAP2 is typically a neuronal marker, its expression in tumor cells could indicate either neuronal differentiation of tumor cells or aberrant activation of neuronal developmental programs[54].\n\nThe cell polarity and axon guidance program includes DCX, MAP2, and related microtubule-associated proteins. This program likely reflects the neuronal lineage relationship between astrocytoma cells and their normal astrocytic and neural progenitor counterparts.\n\n### Notch Signaling and Cell Fate Specification Along Development Gradients\n\nThe Notch signaling pathway is a fundamental developmental signaling system that regulates cell fate decisions through lateral inhibition. DLL1 and DLL3 encode Notch ligands, while MAML2 is a critical coactivator in Notch-responsive transcription[21][24][40]. During embryonic development, Notch signaling in neural tissues establishes gradients of cell fate specification, with high Notch signaling promoting progenitor maintenance and low signaling promoting differentiation. In astrocytoma, dysregulation of Notch signaling could shift the balance toward either increased proliferation (high Notch in tumor-initiating cells) or aberrant differentiation (altered Notch signaling at the invasive margin).\n\nRecent studies using human trunk-like structures (recapitulating embryonic spinal cord development) have demonstrated that DLL1 and DLL3 expression in specific spatial patterns is critical for establishing neural identity and neural-mesenchymal boundaries[21]. In astrocytoma, ectopic expression of Notch ligands and signaling components could create aberrant developmental signals that promote tumor cell proliferation and invasiveness.\n\n## Immunomodulation and Tumor Microenvironment Interactions\n\n### Immune Cell Engagement and Checkpoint Pathways\n\nInterestingly, several genes in the input list have known functions in immune cell regulation. FAS (Fas cell surface death receptor) is not in the input list, but FAS-ligand and related death receptor pathways are implied through related genomic regions and signaling cascades[64]. Additionally, KLRC2 and KLRC3 encode natural killer cell receptors (NKG2C and NKG2E), which are involved in NK cell activation. The presence of NK cell receptor genes in the astrocytoma tumor cell gene list is puzzling, as these genes are typically expressed on NK cells rather than tumor cells. However, some cancers express NK receptor ligands or exploit NK cell signaling molecules for tumor-promoting effects.\n\nAdditionally, genes related to antigen presentation and immune activation, such as HLA molecules and related factors, appear in the broader genomic context of astrocytoma[57]. Recent work has demonstrated that glioblastoma cells can express immune checkpoint ligands (PD-L1, PD-L2) and immunosuppressive factors like IDO, contributing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. While these specific ligands are not in the input list, the presence of KLRC2/3 and related factors suggests that astrocytoma cells engage with immune signaling pathways.\n\nThe immune modulation program, while less complete in the input list than other programs, includes KLRC2, KLRC3, and implied immune-related signaling factors. This program likely reflects both direct effects of tumor cells on immune function and indirect effects through recruitment of immune-suppressive populations like alternatively activated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells.\n\n## Neurological Manifestations and Seizure Susceptibility\n\n### Seizure-Associated Gene Networks and Peritumoral Neuronal Activity\n\nRecent studies have identified correlations between specific gene expression patterns in glioblastoma and tumor-associated seizures (TAS), a common neurological complication affecting approximately 30-40% of patients with supratentorial high-grade gliomas[70]. The peritumoral cortex (PTC) in seizure-susceptible patients shows aberrant neuronal properties including altered intrinsic excitability, enhanced synaptic transmission, and altered expression of genes regulating neurotransmitter signaling and synaptic plasticity[70].\n\nThe presence of multiple glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling genes in the input list is directly relevant to seizure susceptibility. Tumor-derived glutamate, acting through AMPA and kainate receptors (GRIA2, GRIA4, GRIK2), can depolarize peritumoral neurons and increase their firing frequency[70]. Additionally, altered expression of synaptic genes in peritumoral neurons, including multiple genes in the current input list like GRIA2, NRXN1, CNTNAP2, and NXPH1, correlates with seizure susceptibility in glioma patients. The presence of these genes in the tumor cell gene list suggests that tumor cells can express synaptic machinery that influences adjacent neuronal populations through cell-cell signaling or through release of neuromodulators.\n\nThe seizure susceptibility program includes GRIA2, GRIA4, GRIK2, GRID2, GABRB3, NRXN1, CNTNAP2, NXPH1, GRIN genes (implied through related signaling), and other neurotransmitter signaling factors. This program is increasingly recognized as a major driver of neurological complications in astrocytoma patients and represents a potential therapeutic target through modulation of peritumoral neuronal activity.\n\n## Therapeutic Resistance and Adaptive Plasticity Programs\n\n### Metabolic Reprogramming and Therapy-Resistant States\n\nAstrocytomas frequently develop resistance to standard therapies including radiation and chemotherapy. Recent studies have identified multiple mechanisms of adaptive plasticity that enable tumor cells to survive therapy, including metabolic reprogramming, enhanced stemness properties, and shifts toward more aggressive mesenchymal states[58][62][68].\n\nThe presence of genes supporting metabolic flexibility (LDLRAD3, LDLRAD4, REV3L, TFDP2) suggests that astrocytoma cells can rapidly reprogram their metabolism in response to therapy. For example, under radiation therapy, tumor cells undergo metabolic shifts toward enhanced reductive glutamine metabolism and increased lipid synthesis, changes that are supported by the metabolic genes in the input list. Additionally, enhanced error-prone DNA polymerase activity (REV3L) may support the mutation of therapy resistance genes, creating populations with enhanced survival capacity.\n\n### Lineage Plasticity and Cell State Transitions\n\nRecent single-cell transcriptomics studies have revealed that glioblastoma tumors contain populations of cells in intermediate states between classical cell types (OPC-like, NPC-like, AC-like, MES-like). These intermediate states often exhibit enhanced plasticity and therapy resistance[57][59]. The presence of genes supporting both neural differentiation and mesenchymal programs in the input list suggests that astrocytoma cells can occupy or transition between these intermediate states.\n\nFor example, a tumor cell could express both neuronal differentiation genes (GRIA2, NRXN1, MAP2) and mesenchymal genes (ZEB1, CDH2, MMP16) simultaneously, occupying a hybrid state that combines properties of both phenotypes. Such hybrid states often exhibit enhanced invasiveness (from the mesenchymal program) and enhanced responsiveness to neuronal microenvironmental signals (from the neuronal program), enabling both invasion and metabolic coupling with peritumoral neurons.\n\n## Comprehensive JSON Schema Analysis\n\n```json\n{\n  \"context\": {\n    \"cell_type\": \"astrocytoma tumor cells (derived from glial lineage with neuronal differentiation features)\",\n    \"disease\": \"astrocytoma (WHO grades I-IV diffuse astrocytic gliomas)\",\n    \"tissue\": \"brain, particularly cerebral cortex and white matter tracts\"\n  },\n  \"input_genes\": [\n    \"ALCAM\", \"GALNT13\", \"DNM3\", \"ADGRL3\", \"MIR181A2HG\", \"SH3D19\", \"NOVA1\", \"GRIK2\", \"GRIA2\", \"GLCCI1\", \"MAP2\", \"ARPP21\", \"PCDH15\", \"FAM110B\", \"EGFR\", \"MAML2\", \"SNTG1\", \"OR4N2\", \"CSMD3\", \"RAB27B\", \"KLRC2\", \"SOX6\", \"AL353784.1\", \"AL512308.1\", \"AC002069.2\", \"GRIA4\", \"PDE10A\", \"CALCRL\", \"ETV1\", \"PTPRZ1\", \"ZEB1\", \"ELMO1\", \"NRXN1\", \"DPP6\", \"MARCH1\", \"LINC02294\", \"AL110292.1\", \"PHLPP1\", \"BEST3\", \"LDLRAD3\", \"DSCAML1\", \"XKR4\", \"UST\", \"CTNNA2\", \"TMEFF2\", \"SOX4\", \"ADAM22\", \"LINC01322\", \"MIR181A1HG\", \"FERMT1\", \"NOL4\", \"GRID2\", \"LHFPL3\", \"AC233296.1\", \"LRRN1\", \"DLL3\", \"CELF2\", \"RAPGEF4\", \"TOX3\", \"RFTN2\", \"HIP1\", \"BRINP3\", \"CHST9\", \"CBLB\", \"SCN3A\", \"CADM2\", \"DLL1\", \"BCHE\", \"DOK6\", \"SLC2A13\", \"IL1RAPL1\", \"NXPH1\", \"VCAN\", \"VIPR2\", \"MDGA2\", \"AC003991.1\", \"AC007402.1\", \"PID1\", \"SCD5\", \"PHYHIPL\", \"NDST4\", \"NTRK3\", \"ELAVL4\", \"MTSS1\", \"SMOC1\", \"DLGAP1-AS4\", \"KCND2\", \"MMP16\", \"DLGAP1\", \"TMEM196\", \"VCAN-AS1\", \"CXXC4\", \"ZNF804A\", \"CDH2\", \"UGT8\", \"SERINC5\", \"EPB41\", \"SEZ6L\", \"CDH10\", \"EPCAM-DT\", \"PIK3R3\", \"NKD1\", \"RNF150\", \"LUZP2\", \"HES6\", \"ERC2\", \"DCX\", \"REV3L\", \"IGF1R\", \"ARL15\", \"C2ORF27A\", \"DGKB\", \"NCAM2\", \"AL445250.1\", \"FGF12\", \"ANTXR1\", \"NCKAP5\", \"FGF14\", \"SLC44A5\", \"AC009041.2\", \"DSCAM\", \"ATRNL1\", \"RBPJ\", \"SLC24A3\", \"TFDP2\", \"FYN\", \"SCN1A\", \"GABRB3\", \"IMMP2L\", \"CRB1\", \"ZNF804B\", \"LRP1B\", \"LINC02488\", \"LINC02283\", \"LINC00689\", \"SPHKAP\", \"CNTN1\", \"ZNF704\", \"PTPRK\", \"KLF12\", \"KHDRBS3\", \"CNTNAP2\", \"KCNQ1OT1\", \"CSMD1\", \"KCNH8\", \"PEAK1\", \"CACNA1A\", \"JAZF1\", \"KAT2B\", \"CSMD2\", \"AC007319.1\", \"ERBB4\", \"CHST11\", \"SOX11\", \"SLC8A3\", \"CDH13\", \"SOX2-OT\", \"OSBPL8\", \"SH3RF1\", \"PCDH11X\", \"CDH20\", \"OPCML\", \"SLC4A7\", \"CCDC178\", \"NLGN4X\", \"AC004852.2\", \"NPAS3\", \"CASK\", \"CNTN3\", \"PAK3\", \"AC013265.1\", \"CASC15\", \"OLIG2\", \"ZNF124\", \"COL11A1\", \"CREB5\", \"DMD\", \"EYS\", \"CDON\", \"FAM117B\", \"MYT1\", \"RNF165\", \"HECW1\", \"AC019197.1\", \"TNR\", \"AL133346.1\", \"MIR4300HG\", \"MEGF11\", \"KLRC3\", \"ADGRA3\", \"ADAMTS6\", \"LDLRAD4\", \"ADAMTS19\", \"PTCH1\", \"LHFPL3-AS1\", \"LINC00511\", \"LINC00609\", \"PPFIA2\", \"LINC01619\", \"AC112493.1\"\n  ],\n  \"programs\": [\n    {\n      \"program_name\": \"Glutamatergic and GABAergic Neurotransmitter Signaling\",\n      \"description\": \"This program encompasses ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPA, kainate, delta receptors), GABA-A receptors, and associated regulatory proteins that establish functional synaptic transmission in astrocytoma cells.

Additionally, recent work emphasizes that alternative splicing driven by RNA-binding proteins creates transcript diversity that supports cellular heterogeneity and phenotypic plasticity in glioma[60].\",\n      \"significance_score\": 0.80,\n      \"citations\": [\n        {\n          \"source_id\": \"62\",\n          \"notes\": \"Chromatin remodeling in pediatric high-grade glioma\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"source_id\": \"41\",\n          \"notes\": \"ELAVL4 in 3'-UTR-mediated mRNA stabilization\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"source_id\": \"44\",\n          \"notes\": \"ELAVL4 promotes BDNF expression\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"source_id\": \"60\",\n          \"notes\": \"Alternative splicing in glioma cellular heterogeneity\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"supporting_genes\": [\"KAT2B\", \"CXXC4\", \"ELAVL4\", \"NOVA1\", \"ZNF804A\", \"ZNF804B\", \"ZNF704\", \"ZNF124\", \"CELF2\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"program_name\": \"Calcium Signaling and Synaptic Plasticity Integration\",\n      \"description\": \"This program integrates calcium signaling components including calcium-permeable ion channels (GRIA2, GRIA4, GRID2, CACNA1A), calcium exchangers (SLC8A3), and calcium-responsive signaling proteins (CASK) that enable rapid intracellular calcium elevation and downstream signaling cascade activation.

This finding has profound implications for understanding astrocytoma biology and suggests several integrated mechanistic principles.\n\n### Central Thesis: Astrocytomas Maintain Neuronal Program Expression and Exploit Neuron-Tumor Interactions\n\nThe input gene list appears to constitute a **neuronal-competence program** that enables astrocytoma cells to express functional synaptic machinery, engage with peritumoral neurons, and integrate developmentally regulated programs that would normally specify neuronal differentiation or neural progenitor identity. Rather than viewing astrocytoma cells as uniformly dedifferentiated, the presence of these genes suggests that tumor cells maintain or selectively activate neuronal programs as part of their adaptive strategy.\n\n### Functional Domains and Interconnected Networks\n\nThe eight gene programs identified form an integrated network where:\n\n1. **Synaptic programs** (glutamatergic/GABAergic signaling, synaptic adhesion) enable astrocytoma cells to communicate directly with peritumoral neurons through functional synaptic contacts\n2. **Developmental programs** (neural progenitor identity, Notch signaling) maintain tumor cell stemness and proliferative capacity while preventing overt neuronal differentiation\n3. **EMT and invasion programs** enable tumor cell infiltration while maintaining selective expression of synaptic genes that support neuron-tumor crosstalk\n4. **Growth factor signaling programs** integrate growth stimuli with downstream survival and proliferation signals\n5. **Metabolic programs** enable survival under hypoxic, nutrient-limited conditions characteristic of the glioblastoma microenvironment\n6. **Proteolytic programs** drive ECM remodeling and invasion through brain tissue\n7. **Chromatin and transcriptional programs** maintain phenotypic plasticity enabling rapid adaptation\n\n### Clinical Implications and Therapeutic Opportunities\n\nThe presence of complete synaptic signaling machinery in astrocytoma cells suggests novel therapeutic strategies:\n\n**Targeting neuron-tumor synapses**: Blocking adhesion molecules (NRXN1, NLGN4X, CNTNAP2) or neurotransmitter receptors (GRIA2, GRIA4) could disrupt the beneficial effects of neuron-tumor synaptic contacts on tumor cell proliferation and survival, while also potentially reducing tumor-associated seizures[70].\n\n**Modulating glutamate signaling**: Reducing tumor cell release of glutamate or blocking postsynaptic glutamate receptors on peritumoral neurons could reduce seizure activity and potentially prevent tumor-driven neuronal circuit rewiring[70].\n\n**Targeting metabolic plasticity**: The presence of alternative metabolic pathway genes (LDLRAD3, LDLRAD4, REV3L) suggests that conventional metabolic targeting may be compensated. Combining metabolic inhibitors with other pathway-targeted approaches may be necessary to overcome metabolic plasticity.\n\n**Exploiting chromatin remodeling dependencies**: The presence of chromatin-remodeling enzymes and transcriptional regulators suggests that acetylase inhibitors or other chromatin-modifying drugs could disrupt the expression of programs critical for tumor cell survival and plasticity.\n\n### Limitations and Future Directions\n\nThis analysis is anchored in literature describing normal neural development, glial cell biology, and glioblastoma/astrocytoma pathobiology. However, the input gene list likely encompasses some genes with limited or unknown functions in the specific context of astrocytoma, particularly genes from uncharacterized genomic regions (e.g., lncRNAs, antisense transcripts). Future work should:\n\n1. Perform single-cell transcriptomics in astrocytoma samples to identify which tumor cell subpopulations co-express genes from specific programs\n2. Conduct functional validation of program-level predictions through CRISPR-mediated perturbations in appropriate tumor models\n3. Integrate protein-level data through spatial proteomics to validate gene expression predictions\n4. Investigate the mechanistic basis for coordinated expression of seemingly disparate programs (e.g., how cells simultaneously express stemness programs AND invasion programs)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis comprehensive analysis identified eight major gene programs active in astrocytoma cells that collectively enable tumor initiation, progression, and adaptation to the hostile brain microenvironment. The striking enrichment for synaptic and neural development genes suggests that astrocytomas exploit normal developmental programs and neuron-tumor interactions as core mechanisms of tumorigenesis. By organizing genes into functional programs rather than analyzing individual genes in isolation, this framework provides a more mechanistically coherent understanding of astrocytoma biology and identifies multiple potential therapeutic vulnerabilities that might be exploited to improve patient outcomes.",
