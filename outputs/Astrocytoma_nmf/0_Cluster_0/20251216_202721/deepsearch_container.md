## Program: Ion Transport and Astrocyte Homeostasis
Genes encoding ion transporters and channels essential for astrocyte buffering capacity and cellular volume regulation, including aquaporins, sodium-potassium ATPases, and potassium channels critical for maintaining extracellular ion concentrations and preventing excitotoxicity in the brain.

**Predicted impacts**

**Evidence summary**
This program clusters genes encoding ion transporters and channels fundamental to astrocyte physiology. Multiple aquaporins (AQP4, AQP1), sodium-potassium ATPase (ATP1A2), potassium channels (KCNN3, KCNQ5), and bicarbonate transporters (SLC4A4, SLC1A3) form a coordinated system for maintaining ionic gradients and cellular volume. In astrocytoma, dysregulation of these transporters could enhance tumor cell survival and migration while impairing normal supportive astrocyte functions.

In astrocytoma, dysregulation of these factors—particularly increased formin activity or loss of adhesion—promotes tumor cell migration and disrupts the organized astrocytic scaffold that normally supports neural circuits.

## Program: Neurotrophic Signaling and Cell Survival
Genes encoding neurotrophic factors, their receptors, and downstream signaling mediators that regulate survival, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity. Includes NTRK2, LIFR, ERBB4, and related signaling components critical for astrocyte-neuron crosstalk and neuroprotection.

NTRK2 (TrkB) and ERBB4 are receptor tyrosine kinases responding to brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neuregulins respectively. LIFR mediates leukemia inhibitory factor signaling supporting astrocyte survival. Downstream effectors include MAP kinases (MAP3K5, MAPK4) and stress-responsive proteins (DAPK1). In astrocytoma, alterations in this pathway could shift balance from neuroprotective to tumorigenic phenotypes.

YAP1, a Hippo pathway effector, acts as a mechanotransducer coupling physical cues to gene expression. In astrocytoma, dysregulation of these factors could drive de-differentiation toward glioma stem cell phenotypes, away from mature supportive astrocyte functions.
