Through systematic analysis of gene function, cellular localization, pathway membership, and disease-specific dysregulation patterns, we identified coherent clusters representing glutamate homeostasis, extracellular matrix remodeling, synaptic plasticity, developmental signaling, metabolic adaptation, transcriptional control, ion channel dynamics, hypoxia response, protein trafficking, and cell migration. The analysis reveals that astrocytoma-associated gene expression changes coordinately activate developmental programs while simultaneously disrupting normal protective mechanisms in surrounding neural tissue. Multiple supporting genes within each program strengthen functional predictions, particularly where genes act at different levels of the same pathway or where dysregulation of multiple pathway components collectively predicts altered cellular states. The identified programs illuminate how astrocytomas subvert normal developmental signaling while creating a permissive microenvironment for tumor progression and neuronal dysfunction.\n\n## Gene Program Identification and Classification Methodology\n\nThe 200 input genes were subjected to systematic functional clustering based on biological process annotation, cellular compartmentalization, pathway database membership, and established roles in neural development and brain tumor pathology. This analysis prioritized genes with multiple supporting functions and those acting within shared pathways or complexes. The identified 14 programs represent distinct biological processes that collectively characterize the transcriptional landscape of astrocytoma and its interaction with the tumor microenvironment. Each program is anchored in literature describing normal astrocyte and neural physiology, with disease-specific implications drawn from studies of glioma biology, traumatic brain injury-induced astrocyte activation, and tumor-neuron crosstalk mechanisms. The approach emphasizes convergent evidence where multiple genes from the input list collectively strengthen pathway predictions.\n\n## Glutamate Homeostasis and Excitatory Neuronal Signaling\n\nThe astrocyte-mediated regulation of glutamate homeostasis represents a critical protective function that is frequently disrupted in astrocytoma. A substantial subset of the input gene list comprises components of the glutamate-handling machinery and excitatory neurotransmission system, including SLC1A3, SLC1A2, SLC8A1, and associated calcium and potassium channel genes. The solute carrier family member 3 (SLC1A3), also known as GLAST or EAAT1, encodes the primary high-affinity glutamate transporter in astrocytes and is responsible for clearing glutamate from the synaptic cleft and extracellular space[8][10]. Reduced SLC1A3 expression in astrocytes has been documented as a hallmark of reactive transformation following traumatic brain injury, where differential gene expression analysis revealed significant downregulation of this critical transporter in acute TBI astrocytes[1][12]. This downregulation of glutamate reuptake capacity represents a functional deficit that elevates local glutamate concentrations and impairs the termination of excitatory neurotransmission.\n\nThe sodium-calcium exchanger SLC8A1 plays a complementary role in glutamate homeostasis through its regulation of intracellular calcium dynamics and sodium-dependent processes that indirectly modulate astrocyte physiology. Astrocytes express SLC1A2, a related glutamate transporter, which together with SLC1A3 comprises the major glutamate reuptake capacity in the brain. In the context of glioma-associated pathology, aberrant neuronal activity in the peritumoral cortex has been linked to elevation of local glutamate concentration and altered neuronal excitability via impaired glutamate reuptake mechanisms[4][32]. This creates a permissive environment for tumor-associated seizures, wherein glioma cells cause elevation of local glutamate and alter neuronal excitability through non-synaptic xCT transporter systems and by directly impairing astrocytic glutamate reuptake[4][32].\n\nCalcium-activated potassium channels and other ion channels represented in this gene list, including CACNB2 (calcium channel beta subunit), KCNQ5, KCNH7, KCNT2, and TPCN1, collectively regulate the ionic microenvironment that astrocytes maintain around neurons. The calcium handling machinery, particularly through the two-pore channel TPCN1 and the transient receptor potential cation channel TRPC4, allows astrocytes to sense and respond to neuronal activity while simultaneously maintaining calcium homeostasis critical for their glutamate buffering function. The downregulation of genes associated with ion channel regulation, such as Slc1a3 (glutamate transporter regulation), has been shown in acute phase reactive astrocytes[1][12], suggesting that during pathological transformation, astrocytes lose both their glutamate buffering capacity and associated calcium signaling control. This glutamate homeostasis program, when dysregulated, represents a mechanism by which astrocytomas compromise their supportive role and contribute directly to neuronal dysfunction and tumor-associated seizures.\n\n## Extracellular Matrix Remodeling and Cell Adhesion Dynamics\n\nThe extracellular matrix (ECM) represents a critical interface through which astrocytomas communicate with surrounding tissue, and the input gene list includes numerous components of ECM proteins, ECM-modifying enzymes, and cell adhesion molecules. Recent studies using single-cell spatial transcriptomic platforms have demonstrated that ECM signaling pathways are profoundly dysregulated in brain pathologies including glioblastoma, with at least four different glioblastoma cell populations showing unique ECM expression profiles[2][29]. The analysis identified extensive non-overlapping expression signatures of ECM components in glioblastoma stromal cell types, particularly in vascular endothelial cells and microglia/macrophages[2][29].\n\nThe cadherin family members CDH20, CDH11, and CDH18 represent classical adhesion molecules that mediate homophilic cell-cell interactions critical for maintaining tissue architecture and cell sorting during development. In astrocytoma, altered expression of specific cadherins is thought to promote dissociation and invasion. The protocadherin PCDH11X represents an X-linked member of this family with roles in neuronal connections and circuit formation. The PARDI family genes PARD3 and PARD3B encode scaffolding proteins that organize cell polarity and establish the epithelial architecture. Downregulation of genes associated with cell junction assembly and adhesion, including Ptprt, Nrcam, and Cdh19, has been documented in acute phase astrocytes following TBI[1][12], suggesting a general mechanism by which reactive astrocytes and transformed astrocytes alike lose tight adhesion and adopt more migratory phenotypes.\n\nThe ECM protein genes include SPOCK1 and SPARCL1, which encode secreted proteins containing thrombospondin domains that interact with cell surface receptors and modulate cell-ECM interactions. The ADAMTS family member ADAMTS6 encodes a secreted protease that remodels ECM components and has been implicated in cell migration and invasion processes. Laminin alpha-2 (LAMA2) is a major basement membrane component that provides structural support and transmits adhesive signals through integrin receptors. The multi-domain protein FAT3 represents a massive cell adhesion molecule that has been identified as a tumor suppressor in multiple contexts and is known to regulate cell polarity and tissue architecture. The ANKFN1 (ankyrin repeat and fibronectin type III domain containing protein) contains protein-protein interaction domains implicated in cell adhesion and signaling. Collectively, these ECM and adhesion genes represent a program through which astrocytomas remodel the extracellular environment, enhance motility, promote invasion, and alter the mechanical and biochemical properties of the tumor microenvironment.\n\nRecent spatial transcriptomic analysis of glioblastoma demonstrates that ECM ligand-receptor networks between glioma cells and stromal cells show profound dysregulation, suggesting that transformed astrocytes have fundamentally altered their ECM production and adhesion repertoire[2][29]. The downregulation of neuroprotective ECM proteins and upregulation of matrix-degrading enzymes likely promotes local invasion and impairs neuroprotective signaling from the ECM to surrounding neurons.\n\n## Synaptic Plasticity, Synapse Pruning, and Neuronal Circuit Remodeling\n\nThe interaction between astrocytes and synapses represents a fundamental feature of nervous system function, and a notable subset of the input genes encode proteins that directly participate in synaptic structure, function, and elimination. The leucine-rich repeat containing proteins LSAMP (limbic system-associated membrane protein) and LRRC4C represent cell surface molecules that participate in synapse formation and stabilization. The neurexin NRXN1 is a presynaptic adhesion molecule that interacts with postsynaptic neuroligins and represents a core component of the trans-synaptic adhesion machinery. The complement component 1Q-like protein C1QL1 participates in synapse formation and stabilization through interaction with postsynaptic receptors, while SPON1 (spondin 1) and SPOCK1 contribute to synaptogenic signaling through matricellular mechanisms.\n\nThe gene MERTK encodes the Mer tyrosine kinase, a receptor that mediates phagocytosis and has been extensively characterized in the context of synapse pruning and microglial engulfment of synaptic material. Importantly, MERTK expression is upregulated in reactive astrocytes during both acute TBI and chronic neurodegeneration, where it is thought to mediate complement-dependent synapse pruning[1][23]. In the acute phase of TBI, genes such as Mertk, along with C1q components (C1qa) known to tag synapses for elimination, are upregulated in astrocytes[23]. These findings suggest a shared mechanism whereby both reactive astrocytes and astrocytoma-derived cells may inappropriately activate synapse pruning pathways, leading to loss of synaptic connections in the peritumoral cortex and contributing to seizures and neuronal dysfunction.\n\nThe ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 participates in the clearance of synaptic proteins and modulation of synaptic strength through proteasomal and autophagy-mediated pathways. The gene SSBP2 (single strand binding protein 2) has roles in neuronal development and axonal guidance. The CLIP1 (CAP-Gly domain containing linker protein 1) links endocytic vesicles to microtubules and may participate in the trafficking of synaptic components. The transcription factor HES1 (hairy and enhancer of split-1) is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor with known roles in the development and maintenance of inhibitory interneurons and likely influences synaptic circuit properties through effects on neuronal differentiation.\n\nIn the context of astrocytoma, the inappropriate activation of synapse pruning programs—such as those mediated by MERTK and complement-family proteins—would lead to loss of functional synaptic connections in the peritumoral cortex. This mechanism likely contributes to the documented aberrant neural activity in the peritumoral cortex of glioma patients, wherein neurons show altered electrophysiological properties and enhanced seizure susceptibility[4][32]. The transcriptomic analysis of peritumoral neurons from patients with tumor-associated seizures revealed a distinct set of genes significantly upregulated or downregulated compared to non-seizure patients, with notable enrichment of genes implicated in the regulation of neuronal homeostasis, synaptic transmission, and synaptic plasticity[4][32].\n\n## Growth Factor Signaling and Reactivation of Developmental Programs\n\nA substantial portion of the input gene list comprises components of growth factor signaling cascades and developmental transcription factors that are known to be reactivated in glioma cells. The fibroblast growth factor receptor FGFR2 represents a receptor tyrosine kinase that activates PI3K-Akt and MAPK pathways in response to FGF ligands and has well-established roles in development of the nervous system. Temporal analysis of reactive astrocytes has revealed that genes involved in neuron-astrocyte interactions, such as Fgfr2, are significantly upregulated specifically in the chronic phase of TBI[1][23], suggesting a sustained engagement of growth factor signaling in chronically activated astrocytes.\n\nThe insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) similarly activates PI3K-Akt and MAPK cascades in response to IGF-1 and IGF-2 and promotes cell survival, proliferation, and protein synthesis. The gene PAPPA encodes pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, a secreted metalloprotease that cleaves insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) and thereby increases local IGF bioavailability. The presence of both IGF1R and PAPPA in the input list suggests coordinated IGF signaling in the context of astrocytoma, where this pathway is known to promote proliferation and survival of tumor-derived cells.\n\nThe basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors HES1 and HES4 are canonical Notch target genes that regulate the balance between neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation. Studies of glioblastoma development have demonstrated that canonical glioblastoma mutations promote functional plasticity through transitions toward a neuronal progenitor network[3][28]. Notably, the transcription factor INSM1, while not present in the input gene list, is highly expressed in glioblastoma and governs a neuronal progenitor state that drives tumor cell evolution[3][28]. The developmental programs governed by HES1 and HES4 are thus likely coopted by astrocytoma cells to maintain a progenitor-like state and resist differentiation.\n\nThe transcription factor ID4 encodes an inhibitor of differentiation belonging to the helix-loop-helix family and is known to maintain neural stem cell identity and prevent neuronal differentiation. The presence of genes promoting progenitor maintenance and proliferation (HES1, HES4, ID4, NPAS3) in the input list suggests that astrocytomas maintain an active developmental program that preserves stemness and resists terminal differentiation. This interpretation is consistent with the characterization of glioblastoma as a tumor marked by functional plasticity driven by tumor cell-intrinsic mutations and their interplay with developmental programs[3][28].\n\n## Metabolic Reprogramming and Energy Adaptation\n\nCancer cells, including glioblastoma, undergo profound metabolic reprogramming to support rapid proliferation and survival in the nutrient-limited tumor microenvironment. The input gene list includes several genes directly involved in metabolic processes that are known to be dysregulated in cancer. MTHFD2 (methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2) encodes a mitochondrial enzyme in one-carbon metabolism that supports both nucleotide synthesis and cellular redox balance, and is highly expressed in rapidly proliferating cancer cells. GCLC (glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit) catalyzes the first committed step in glutathione synthesis, the major cellular antioxidant, and is often upregulated in cancers to support survival under oxidative stress.\n\nALDH1L1 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member L1) encodes a cytoplasmic aldehyde dehydrogenase involved in both one-carbon metabolism and the breakdown of acetaldehyde, and notably ALDH1L1 is the primary marker gene for mature astrocytes, making this a particularly relevant gene for understanding astrocyte-derived tumors. The PDE3A (phosphodiesterase 3A) gene encodes a phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes cGMP and cAMP, thereby regulating these critical second messengers and indirectly controlling metabolic processes and gene expression. The DGKG (diacylglycerol kinase gamma) gene encodes an enzyme in lipid signaling that converts diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid, thus regulating both membrane lipid composition and the availability of lipid signaling mediators.\n\nMetabolic adaptation and the transition toward enhanced glucose metabolism (the Warburg effect) has been extensively characterized in glioblastoma and likely involves coordinated upregulation of glycolytic enzymes and the pentose phosphate pathway. Genes such as HEPACAM (hepatitis A virus cellular receptor), while primarily characterized as a cell surface adhesion molecule, may also participate in metabolic signaling through its interactions with other cell surface receptors. The involvement of multiple metabolic genes in the input list suggests that astrocytoma cells maintain active metabolic remodeling to support rapid cell division and enhanced biosynthetic capacity.\n\n## Transcriptional Regulation and Control of Cell Fate and Differentiation\n\nThe control of cell fate—whether to remain in a progenitor state or proceed to differentiation—is governed by complex transcriptional regulatory networks involving multiple families of transcription factors. The input gene list includes numerous transcriptional regulators: FOXP2 (forkhead box P2), FOXO1 (forkhead box O1), NPAS3 (neuronal PAS domain protein 3), HES1, HES4, RFX4 (regulatory factor X4), ESRRG (estrogen receptor related gamma), RORA (retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor alpha), RBMS3 (RNA binding motif single stranded interacting protein 3), and TLE1 (transducin-like enhancer of split 1).\n\nFOXP2 is a winged-helix transcription factor with well-established roles in nervous system development and is frequently dysregulated in various brain tumors and developmental disorders. FOXO1 encodes a forkhead transcription factor that typically acts as a tumor suppressor by promoting cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation, and conversely its loss or downregulation would be predicted to promote cancer progression. NPAS3 is a transcription factor with roles in neural development and stress responses. RFX4 encodes a regulatory factor with DNA-binding activity implicated in transcriptional control of genes involved in cilia formation and neurogenesis.\n\nESRRG encodes a nuclear receptor with roles in metabolic regulation and development. RORA is a nuclear receptor implicated in circadian rhythm regulation, immune function, and metabolic processes. TLE1 encodes a Groucho-family transcriptional corepressor that interacts with multiple transcription factors to modulate their activity. The presence of multiple transcriptional regulators suggests that astrocytomas maintain complex transcriptional control networks that coordinate the activation of growth-promoting programs while simultaneously suppressing differentiation signals.\n\nThe broader dysregulation of transcriptional control in astrocytoma is evidenced by studies showing that canonical astrocytoma mutations promote functional plasticity through transitions toward a neuronal progenitor network driven by specific transcription factors[3][28]. The downregulation or loss of function of differentiation-promoting transcription factors, combined with maintenance of stemness factors, would collectively maintain tumor cells in a proliferative, undifferentiated state.\n\n## Ion Channel Function and Calcium Signaling in Astrocyte Physiology\n\nAstrocytes maintain specialized calcium signaling machinery that allows them to sense neuronal activity, modulate synaptic transmission, and regulate the local neuronal microenvironment. The input gene list includes multiple genes encoding voltage-gated and ligand-gated ion channels, as well as calcium handling proteins. These include CACNB2 (calcium channel beta-2 subunit), KCNQ5 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 5), KCNH7 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 7), KCNT2 (potassium channel subfamily T member 2), KCNIP1 (potassium channel interacting protein 1), TPCN1 (two pore segment channel 1), and TRPC4 (transient receptor potential canonical member 4).\n\nCACNB2 encodes the auxiliary beta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, which stabilizes channel expression and modulates kinetics. KCNQ5 encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel involved in regulating neuronal excitability and has roles in astrocyte physiology through effects on astrocyte membrane potential and calcium signaling dynamics. KCNH7 encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel with roles in setting the resting membrane potential and controlling neuronal firing patterns. TRPC4 is implicated specifically in the regulation of calcium homeostasis in astrocytes, where it participates in store-operated calcium entry and contributes to astrocytic calcium signals in response to neurotransmitter signaling[26].\n\nThe ATP2B2 gene encodes a plasma membrane calcium pump that extrudes calcium from the cell in exchange for ATP hydrolysis, and is critical for maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis. Dysregulation of calcium signaling in astrocytes is known to impair their ability to buffer glutamate and modulate synaptic transmission. The documented elevation of local glutamate concentration in the peritumoral region of gliomas is thought to result partly from impaired calcium-dependent glutamate uptake in transformed astrocytes. The disruption of normal calcium signaling in astrocytes would thus propagate further dysfunction in the excitatory-inhibitory balance of peritumoral neurons and likely contribute to seizure susceptibility.\n\n## Hypoxia Response and Microenvironmental Adaptation\n\nThe tumor microenvironment is characterized by regions of varying oxygen availability, and hypoxic regions drive the selection for cells capable of surviving and proliferating under low oxygen tension. Two genes in the input list, HIF1A and HIF3A, encode hypoxia-inducible transcription factors that regulate adaptive responses to hypoxia. HIF1A (hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha) is a master transcription factor that activates a broad program of genes involved in glucose metabolism, angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and cell survival under hypoxic conditions. HIF3A encodes a related factor with overlapping but distinct target gene specificity.\n\nThe incoherent feedforward loops (IFFLs) mediated by HIF-1 have been recently characterized in the context of cycling hypoxia, wherein HIF-1 cooperates with additional transcription factors such as p53 and Notch1 to generate hypoxia-specific gene expression patterns that would not occur under stable hypoxia or normoxia[31]. This finding is particularly relevant to tumors, which frequently experience cycling hypoxia as a result of intermittent perfusion failures and vascular remodeling. The gene RORA (retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor alpha) also has roles in metabolic adaptation and circadian regulation and may participate in hypoxic adaptation through metabolic rewiring.\n\nThe involvement of HIF-regulated transcription factors in the input gene list suggests that astrocytomas maintain active hypoxic adaptation mechanisms that promote survival in the hypoxic tumor core while simultaneously contributing to angiogenic signaling that promotes neovascularization. The dysregulation of hypoxic adaptation mechanisms would thus promote tumor growth and resistance to therapeutic interventions.\n\n## Protein Degradation, Trafficking, and Cellular Turnover\n\nThe ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy-lysosomal pathway represent critical mechanisms through which cells regulate protein levels, clear misfolded proteins, and maintain cellular homeostasis. The input gene list includes several genes involved in protein ubiquitination and degradation: NEDD4 (neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated 4, E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase), RNF150 (ring finger protein 150), ZNRF3 (zinc and ring finger proteins 3, E3 ubiquitin ligase), MARCH3 (membrane-associated ring-CH-type finger proteins 3), and TRIM9 (tripartite motif containing 9).\n\nNEDD4 is a prominent E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets numerous substrate proteins for proteasomal degradation and autophagy, including ion channels, adhesion molecules, and signaling proteins. Its dysregulation can promote cancer progression by allowing stabilization of oncogenic proteins while simultaneously degrading tumor suppressors. RNF150 encodes a ring finger ubiquitin ligase with roles in neuronal development. ZNRF3 encodes another E3 ubiquitin ligase with roles in stem cell regulation and Wnt signaling. MARCH3 encodes a membrane-associated ubiquitin ligase involved in endocytic trafficking and surface protein regulation. TRIM9 is a tripartite motif protein with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity involved in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity.\n\nThe endocytic trafficking machinery is represented by genes such as CLIP1 (CAP-Gly domain containing linker protein 1), which links endocytic vesicles to microtubules and facilitates their transport to degradative compartments. The spatiotemporal control of protein distribution through trafficking is critical for maintaining proper cellular function and for the regulated activation and inactivation of signaling pathways. Dysregulation of protein degradation and trafficking pathways in astrocytomas would promote the accumulation of oncogenic proteins while simultaneously facilitating the clearance of growth-inhibitory proteins, collectively favoring tumor progression.\n\n## Cell Migration, Invasion, and Cytoskeletal Organization\n\nThe capacity for rapid cell migration and invasion through tissue represents a hallmark of malignant gliomas and is essential for both local invasion and metastatic dissemination. The input gene list includes numerous genes involved in actin cytoskeleton remodeling, microtubule dynamics, and the molecular machinery of cell migration. These include FRY (furry homolog), MYO10 (myosin X), LRRC1 (leucine rich repeat containing 1), LRRC4C (leucine rich repeat containing 4C), ANLN (anillin actin binding protein), ADD3 (adducin 3), ARHGAP24 (Rho GTPase activating protein 24), ARHGAP31 (Rho GTPase activating protein 31), DOCK4 (dedicator of cytokinesis 4), and DISP1 (dispatched 1).\n\nFRY encodes a protein involved in the organization and regulation of actin filaments and is thought to promote cell migration through effects on lamellipodia formation and dynamics. MYO10 is a myosin motor protein that participates in cell migration and the formation of filopodia, actin-rich cellular protrusions that facilitate cell migration and invasion. LRRC1 and LRRC4C encode leucine-rich repeat proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion. ANLN encodes anillin, an actin-binding protein that participates in cytokinesis and cell migration through its effects on actin filament organization and bundling.\n\nADD3 encodes adducin, a cytoskeletal protein that promotes actin filament assembly and organization at the cell periphery. ARHGAP24 and ARHGAP31 encode Rho GTPase-activating proteins that negatively regulate Rho family GTPases and thereby inhibit actin stress fiber formation and cell migration. Notably, the presence of both pro-migratory and anti-migratory genes in the input list suggests a complex, dynamic regulation of migration that is tumor context-dependent. DOCK4 encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPases that promotes lamellipodial protrusion and cell migration.\n\nThe dysregulation of actin dynamics and cell migration genes in astrocytomas would collectively enhance cell motility, promote invasion, and facilitate the dissemination of tumor cells through brain tissue. The documented remodeling of cell-cell junctions and ECM that we discuss above would additionally remove physical barriers to cell migration and invasion.\n\n## Receptor Signaling and Cell-Cell Communication\n\nThe interaction between tumor cells and their microenvironment involves complex signaling through numerous cell surface receptors. The input gene list includes several receptor tyrosine kinases and associated signaling molecules: EPHA5 (ephrin receptor A5), EPHB1 (ephrin receptor B1), FGFR2 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 2), IGF1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor), and other transmembrane and secreted proteins involved in intercellular communication.\n\nEPHB1 and EPHA5 encode members of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which are activated by their ephrin ligands to promote diverse cellular responses including cell migration, axonal guidance, and synaptic plasticity. Recent studies have characterized the role of EphB1 in neural signaling, wherein the ephrinB-EphB1 receptor signaling pathway excites neurons through phosphorylation of NMDAR subunit NR2B at tyrosine-1472 and disinhibits neurons through ubiquitin degradation of the potassium-chloride co-transporter 2 (KCC2)[19]. The EphB receptors are widely involved in thalamocortical synaptogenesis during development and synaptic transmission in mature neurons[19]. \n\nIn the context of astrocytoma, ephrin-Eph signaling is known to mediate astrocyte-neuron interactions and can promote neuronal excitability. The presence of both EPHB1 and ephrin ligands in the peritumoral cortex could thus promote the documented aberrant neural activity and seizure susceptibility in tumor-associated seizures. Astrocytic ephrin-B1 has been shown to control excitatory-inhibitory balance in developing hippocampus[21], and dysregulation of this signaling by tumor-derived astrocytes would compromise the normal balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition.\n\n## Genetic and Molecular Alterations Specific to Astrocytoma Pathogenesis\n\nThe transformation of normal astrocytes into malignant astrocytoma requires acquisition of specific genetic and epigenetic alterations that drive proliferation, block differentiation, and enhance survival. While the input gene list does not contain the canonical driver mutations of glioblastoma (such as TP53, PTEN, PDGFRA, which are discussed in the context of tumor evolution[3][28]), several genes in the list have known tumor suppressor or oncogenic properties that are relevant to astrocytoma progression.\n\nThe gene FAT3 encodes a large cadherin-family protein that functions as a tumor suppressor in various cancers through effects on cell polarity, Hippo pathway signaling, and cell-cell adhesion. The gene DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) encodes a cell surface receptor for netrin ligands that functions as a tumor suppressor through effects on cell migration and apoptosis. The downregulation or mutation of tumor suppressor genes such as FAT3 and DCC would be expected to promote astrocytoma progression by removing differentiation and migration brakes. Conversely, the maintenance of oncogenic signaling through genes such as IGF1R, FGFR2, and associated growth factor pathways would promote tumor cell proliferation.\n\nRecent studies have demonstrated that astrocytomas (particularly lower-grade astrocytomas) arise from neural stem/progenitor cells and retain characteristics of these multipotent populations. The comparative analysis of gene expression between glioblastoma and lower-grade astrocytoma samples using spatial transcriptomic approaches has identified differential expression of key genes involved in ECM remodeling and cellular differentiation[2][29]. These findings suggest that the developmental programs reactivated in astrocytoma create a permissive state for tumor initiation and progression.\n\n## Inflammatory and Immune-Related Processes\n\nWhile the primary focus of the input gene list is on direct tumor cell functions, several genes in the list have roles in immune signaling and neuroinflammation. The gene PAG1 (phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid microdomains 1) encodes a membrane-associated adapter protein involved in T cell signaling and immune cell activation. TACR1 (tachykinin receptor 1) encodes the receptor for substance P, a neuropeptide involved in pain signaling and immune cell recruitment. HNMT (histamine N-methyltransferase) encodes an enzyme involved in histamine metabolism, which is implicated in inflammatory responses.\n\nThe broader inflammatory microenvironment of gliomas is characterized by profound immunosuppression and altered immune cell recruitment and activation. Recent reviews have emphasized that the limited efficacy of immunotherapies in gliomas is largely attributed to the brain's immune-privileged status and the profoundly immunosuppressive nature of the glioma tumor microenvironment[41][43]. The recruitment and activation of immunosuppressive myeloid cells, including microglia and infiltrating macrophages, creates an anti-inflammatory microenvironment that permits tumor progression.\n\n## Long Non-Coding RNA Functions\n\nSeveral entries in the input gene list represent long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), including LINC01677, ENTPD1-AS1, POT1-AS1, LINC01748, MIR99AHG, LINC01117, LINC00461, and SLC8A1-AS1. These lncRNAs represent functional regulators of gene expression through multiple mechanisms including transcriptional control, alternative splicing, and modulation of protein function. LncRNAs are increasingly recognized as critical regulators of cancer cell behavior, and dysregulation of specific lncRNA expression is associated with glioma progression. The presence of multiple lncRNA genes in the input list suggests that post-transcriptional and epigenetic regulation mechanisms are integral to the astrocytoma transcriptional landscape, though the specific functions of many of these lncRNAs remain to be fully characterized.\n\n## Neurodegeneration-Associated Genes and Links to Chronic CNS Pathology\n\nSeveral genes in the input list are known to be dysregulated in chronic neurodegeneration and have been characterized in the context of Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and other neurodegenerative conditions. These include NDRG2 (NDRG family member 2), APP (amyloid beta precursor protein, though not directly in the list, it is referenced as upregulated in chronic TBI), and genes involved in synapse pruning such as MERTK. The upregulation of neurodegeneration-associated genes in astrocytomas is thought to reflect a chronic inflammatory state and ongoing neuronal dysfunction in the tumor microenvironment.\n\nThe temporal transcriptomic analysis of reactive astrocytes in TBI models revealed that genes involved in chronic neurodegeneration, such as App and S1pr1, were significantly upregulated specifically in the chronic phase of TBI[1][23]. This suggests that chronically activated astrocytes acquire a neurodegenerative gene expression signature that promotes ongoing neuronal loss and dysfunction. By analogy, astrocytoma-derived astrocytes would be expected to maintain a similar neurodegenerative phenotype that contributes to progressive neuronal loss in the peritumoral region.\n\n## Integration and Functional Predictions Across Gene Programs\n\nThe 14 identified gene programs collectively characterize the transcriptional and functional landscape of astrocytoma and its interactions with the surrounding neural tissue. The coordinated upregulation of growth factor signaling, developmental programs, and metabolic adaptation genes would collectively promote tumor cell proliferation and survival. Simultaneously, the dysregulation of glutamate homeostasis, calcium signaling, and synaptic plasticity genes would compromise the normal supportive function of astrocytes and contribute to neuronal dysfunction and seizure susceptibility in the peritumoral cortex.\n\nThe remodeling of cell adhesion and ECM, combined with enhanced cell migration and invasion capabilities, would facilitate tumor progression and local invasion. The dysregulation of transcriptional control networks would maintain tumor cells in a progenitor-like, proliferative state resistant to differentiation. The activation of hypoxic adaptation pathways would promote survival in the hypoxic tumor core. The dysregulation of protein degradation and trafficking pathways would allow selective stabilization of oncogenic proteins while promoting clearance of tumor suppressors.\n\nNotably, the convergence of multiple dysregulated pathways on common downstream effectors (such as astrocytic calcium signaling, which is controlled by both ion channels and glutamate transporters) suggests that the pathological consequences of astrocytoma on the surrounding neural tissue may be greater than the sum of individual pathway perturbations. The documented aberrant neural activity in the peritumoral cortex, characterized by enhanced seizure susceptibility and altered excitatory-inhibitory balance, likely results from the coordinated dysregulation of multiple programs affecting glutamate homeostasis, calcium signaling, synaptic plasticity, and the production of astrocyte-derived synaptogenic factors.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis comprehensive analysis of 200 genes in the context of astrocytoma has identified 14 distinct gene programs that collectively characterize the transformed astrocyte phenotype and its pathological interactions with the surrounding neural microenvironment. The programs span fundamental cellular processes including glutamate homeostasis, extracellular matrix remodeling, synaptic plasticity, developmental signaling, metabolic adaptation, transcriptional control, ion channel function, hypoxia response, protein trafficking, and cell migration. The convergent dysregulation of multiple programs coordinating around common endpoints—such as the elevation of extracellular glutamate, dysregulation of astrocytic calcium signaling, and enhanced seizure susceptibility—suggests that astrocytoma pathogenesis involves the coordinated activation of pro-tumor programs while simultaneously suppressing protective astrocytic functions.\n\nThe identification of these programs provides a foundation for understanding the molecular basis of astrocytoma development and progression, as well as for identifying potential therapeutic targets. Future studies should focus on validating these predicted gene programs in patient-derived astrocytoma samples, characterizing the temporal dynamics of program activation during tumor evolution, and identifying therapeutic strategies that can restore normal astrocytic function while simultaneously targeting tumor cell proliferation.\n\n---\n\n## Structured JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"context\": {\n    \"cell_type\": \"astrocyte\",\n    \"disease\": \"astrocytoma\",\n    \"tissue\": \"brain\"\n  },\n  \"input_genes\": [\n    \"THSD4\", \"STK17B\", \"ADAMTS6\", \"AGMO\", \"AKAP6\", \"IQSEC2\", \"OPHN1\", \"AL355306.2\", \"HEPACAM\", \"KIAA1211\", \"GHR\", \"PLCB1\", \"NHSL1\", \"PARD3B\", \"FMNL3\", \"PARD3\", \"CSGALNACT1\", \"CTDSPL\", \"SLC8A1\", \"RIDA\", \"SNX7\", \"EPHB1\", \"AL589740.1\", \"HIF3A\", \"AKAP13\", \"DCC\", \"TMEM132C\", \"CDH20\", \"SEMA4B\", \"RNF150\", \"GRK3\", \"PCSK2\", \"AL590617.2\", \"EAF2\", \"FAT3\", \"ANKFN1\", \"PHACTR1\", \"GLYATL2\", \"SORCS3\", \"SYBU\", \"CACNB2\", \"ATP13A4\", \"FOXO1\", \"SSBP2\", \"PTPRT\", \"RAD51B\", \"FRY\", \"MERTK\", \"SLC1A3\", \"PAPLN\", \"NDRG2\", \"NKAIN3\", \"KCNIP1\", \"MME\", \"AC091826.2\", \"KCNH7\", \"AC092902.4\", \"AC068587.4\", \"TPCN1\", \"LINC01677\", \"ENTPD1-AS1\", \"EFR3B\", \"MXI1\", \"RGCC\", \"RFX4\", \"ESRRG\", \"RASL10A\", \"RBMS3\", \"MYO10\", \"LRIG1\", \"NCEH1\", \"LINC01748\", \"EPHA5\", \"MT1X\", \"LRRC1\", \"LSAMP\", \"SLC1A2\", \"SLC15A2\", \"CPNE5\", \"MIR99AHG\", \"MCF2L2\", \"MARCH3\", \"MAP2K6\", \"DDAH1\", \"LRRC4C\", \"DGKG\", \"SCG3\", \"DIPK1A\", \"DISP1\", \"RORA\", \"DOCK4\", \"MTHFD2\", \"LINC01117\", \"ID4\", \"FGFR2\", \"PDE3A\", \"PCTP\", \"KLHL25\", \"KCNT2\", \"CNKSR2\", \"KCNQ5\", \"NRXN1\", \"HEPN1\", \"OSBPL11\", \"HES1\", \"HES4\", \"IL3RA\", \"HIF1A\", \"PAPPA\", \"HMCN1\", \"HNMT\", \"GRAMD2B\", \"GPM6A\", \"PTPRG\", \"PDZRN3\", \"LINC00461\", \"HTRA1\", \"FRMD4A\", \"NEDD4\", \"FTCDNL1\", \"NHS\", \"FXYD7\", \"PPP2R2B\", \"POT1-AS1\", \"GCLC\", \"LAMA2\", \"GINS3\", \"PITPNC1\", \"KYAT1\", \"NPAS3\", \"FOXP2\", \"ZNRF3\", \"CLIP1\", \"C1ORF61\", \"BBOX1\", \"STON2\", \"STK33\", \"TTN\", \"AC093535.1\", \"TMEM108\", \"C1QL1\", \"TSHR\", \"SPON1\", \"SPOCK1\", \"SPARCL1\", \"SORL1\", \"CCDC141\", \"AC087564.1\", \"B3GNT5\", \"AC114760.2\", \"CCDC178\", \"ANLN\", \"TLE1\", \"ALDH1L1\", \"AMER2\", \"ADIPOR2\", \"ADD3\", \"ADCY8\", \"ACSS1\", \"ATP2B2\", \"TACR1\", \"ARHGAP24\", \"TAB2\", \"ARHGAP31\", \"ASB18\", \"ASTN2\", \"SNCAIP\", \"ST6GAL2\", \"TLN2\", \"AC007364.1\", \"SLC8A1-AS1\", \"AC008957.2\", \"CDH18\", \"AC008127.1\", \"CDH11\", \"CHST9\", \"AC019068.1\", \"CLEC16A\", \"SLITRK5\", \"CCDC7\", \"ZNF521\", \"AC007262.2\", \"MMP25-AS1\", \"NUMB\", \"OGFRL1\", \"TRPC4\", \"TMEM178A\", \"MROH9\", \"TRMT9B\", \"TMEM65\", \"OSBPL6\", \"PCDH11X\", \"TRIM9\", \"P4HA1\", \"MPP6\", \"PAG1\", \"ZNF423\", \"PAM\", \"TMTC2\", \"TPM1\"\n  ],\n  \"programs\": [\n    {\n      \"program_name\": \"Glutamate Homeostasis and Excitatory Signaling\",\n      \"description\": \"Astrocyte-mediated clearance of synaptic glutamate and regulation of extracellular glutamate concentration through high-affinity transporters, coupled with calcium-dependent signaling and ion channel activity that modulates astrocytic physiology and indirectly affects synaptic glutamate handling.
