The research will synthesize current understanding of genetic interactions, focusing on how these molecular alterations impact cellular dynamics in astrocytic tumors.\n</think>\n\n# Comprehensive Functional Analysis of 201 Genes in Astrocytoma Biology: Gene Programs and Cellular Implications\n\nThis comprehensive literature analysis identifies ten major gene programs derived from the 201-gene input list, organized around coherent biological functions including synaptic transmission, ion channel regulation, axon guidance, postsynaptic scaffolding, cytoskeletal dynamics, RNA splicing, extracellular matrix interactions, glial-neuronal signaling, transcriptional regulation, and metabolic adaptation. These programs collectively illuminate how dysregulation of neuronal developmental programs contributes to astrocytoma pathogenesis, tumor cell plasticity, and interactions with the peritumoral microenvironment. The analysis reveals that aberrant reactivation of developmental transcriptional networks, altered synaptic architecture in tumor-adjacent neurons, and dysregulated cell-cell communication mechanisms through guidance molecules and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling constitute core features of astrocytoma biology and represent promising therapeutic targets.\n\n## Gene Programs and Functional Organization\n\n### Program 1: Glutamatergic Synaptic Transmission and Plasticity\n\nThe glutamatergic synaptic transmission program represents one of the most extensively characterized functions within the input gene list and comprises genes encoding ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, their associated signaling machinery, and calcium-dependent plasticity mechanisms. The ionotropic NMDA receptor subunits GRIN1, GRIN2A, and GRIN2B form the core of this program, functioning as ligand-gated ion channels that mediate excitatory synaptic transmission and support long-term potentiation and depression[39][41]. These NMDA receptors transduce glutamate signals and allow calcium influx that drives synaptic plasticity, a process essential for normal neural circuit function but potentially dysregulated in tumor contexts. Metabotropic glutamate receptors GRM5 and GRM7 couple to G-protein signaling cascades that modulate synaptic strength through alternative second messenger pathways, providing additional layers of plasticity regulation[7]. The primary ionotropic AMPA receptor subunit GRIA1 functions as a component of fast excitatory synaptic transmission and, importantly, shows developmental regulation and activity-dependent trafficking that may be altered in astrocytoma-associated neuronal dysfunction[26].\n\nThe supporting cast of this program includes calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases CAMK2A and CAMK2B, which phosphorylate NMDA receptors and AMPA receptors in an activity-dependent manner to strengthen synaptic transmission and support long-term potentiation[40][42]. The scaffolding proteins DLG2, GRIP1, and GRIP2 organize postsynaptic receptors and anchor signaling complexes at the synapse, enabling coordinated transmission of excitatory signals. The presynaptic machinery includes SYT1 and SYT14 (synaptotagmin proteins), which couple calcium influx to vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release[7], and RIMS1 and RIMS2 (RIM proteins), which organize the active zone and control readily releasable pool properties[16]. When examined in the context of peritumoral neurons adjacent to glioblastoma and astrocytoma, enhanced glutamatergic signaling contributes to neuronal hyperexcitability and seizure susceptibility, potentially through tumor-derived glutamate elevation and altered receptor trafficking[26][33].\n\nThis program's dysregulation in astrocytoma manifests through multiple mechanisms. Research on glioblastoma-associated seizures demonstrates that peritumoral pyramidal neurons exhibit increased dendritic spine densities and enhanced glutamatergic inputs, which computational modeling reveals are sufficient to drive paroxysmal depolarizing shifts that precede overt seizures[26]. The elevated expression of genes encoding NMDA receptor subunits and associated signaling machinery in glioma-adjacent tissue suggests that developmental programs promoting neuronal-glial interactions are reactivated during tumor growth. Furthermore, the fact that both GRIN2A and GRM8 show altered expression patterns in Alzheimer's disease-related neurodegeneration and tau pathology[7] raises the intriguing possibility that similar excitotoxic mechanisms may be engaged in chronic astrocytoma contexts where long-term tumor presence drives progressive neuronal loss in the peritumoral zone.\n\n### Program 2: GABAergic Inhibitory Synaptic Transmission\n\nThe GABAergic synaptic transmission program encompasses the genes encoding ionotropic GABA-A receptors (GABRA2, GABRB1, GABRG2), metabotropic GABA-B receptors (GABBR2), and associated inhibitory synaptic machinery. GABRA2, GABRB1, and GABRG2 encode distinct subunits of GABA-A receptors that form chloride channels mediating fast inhibitory transmission and supporting synaptic plasticity through subunit composition changes. The metabotropic GABA-B receptor component GABBR2 couples to G-protein pathways that modulate presynaptic calcium channels and suppress neurotransmitter release, providing a slower but longer-lasting inhibitory mechanism[49]. The distinction between ionotropic and metabotropic inhibition allows neurons to integrate timing information and regulate circuit-level excitatory-inhibitory balance.\n\nIn the context of astrocytoma and peritumoral neurobiology, dysfunction of GABAergic inhibition represents a critical mechanism promoting tumor-associated seizures. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in networks adjacent to tumors shifts toward excessive excitation, either through enhanced glutamatergic drive or reduced inhibitory signaling. Glioma-derived soluble factors, including elevated glutamate, can impair GABAergic neurotransmission directly or through indirect mechanisms involving altered astrocyte function and reduced GABA reuptake[33]. The presence of inflammatory cytokines in the tumor microenvironment further disrupts the balance by preferentially affecting inhibitory interneurons. Research using inducible glioma models has shown that as tumors progress, the peritumoral cortex develops characteristic electrophysiological abnormalities including increased gamma-band activity and spike-wave discharges indicative of synchronous firing, which would be expected when GABAergic inhibition is compromised[33].\n\nThe specific role of GABBR2 in this program is noteworthy, as metabotropic GABA-B signaling normally provides presynaptic inhibition and homeostatic regulation of circuit excitability. Loss or dysfunction of this mechanism in the face of expanding tumors would accelerate the shift toward hyperexcitability. Furthermore, some astrocytomas and low-grade gliomas express neuronal marker genes and exhibit neurogenic potential, suggesting that dysregulation of inhibitory programs may contribute to the reported neuronal differentiation capacity of certain glioma subsets. The expression of GABAergic machinery genes in tumor-adjacent tissue also raises the possibility that reactive gliosis and astrocyte activation in response to tumor presence produce changes in local GABAergic signaling, either through direct effects on inhibitory neurons or through indirect effects on interneuron precursor differentiation.\n\n### Program 3: Voltage-Gated Ion Channels and Neuronal Excitability\n\nThe voltage-gated ion channel program comprises calcium channel subunits (CACNA1C, CACNA1D, CACNA1E), potassium channel subunits (KCNQ3, KCNC2, KCNJ3, KCNMA1, KCNMB2), and sodium channel auxiliary proteins (SCN2A, SCN3B). These genes collectively encode the molecular determinants of neuronal resting potential, action potential generation, repolarization, and intrinsic excitability. CACNA1C (L-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1C) has emerged as a pleiotropic psychiatric disease gene implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric conditions, with its genetic variation associated with brainstem volume and potentially affecting neural circuit development[9][12]. The other calcium channel subunits CACNA1D and CACNA1E provide distinct biophysical properties and subcellular localizations, with CACNA1E showing particular enrichment in cerebellar and cortical circuits.\n\nThe potassium channel subunits provide the repolarizing conductances essential for maintaining frequency-dependent firing properties and regulating intrinsic excitability. KCNQ3, encoding the M-channel component, plays a critical role in controlling subthreshold voltage dynamics and suppressing neuronal hyperexcitability; mutations in this gene are associated with neonatal epilepsy and point to its essential role in maintaining circuit stability[9]. KCNC2 encodes a Kv3-family potassium channel implicated in fast-spiking interneurons, and its dysregulation would specifically compromise the ability of inhibitory neurons to discharge at high frequencies, thereby impairing their capacity to suppress excitatory drive. KCNJ3 encodes an inwardly rectifying potassium channel involved in setting resting membrane potential and controlling excitability at physiologically relevant voltages. KCNMA1 and KCNMB2 form the BK (big potassium) channel, which couples membrane depolarization and calcium influx to potassium conductance, providing rapid feedback inhibition of action potential generation and stabilizing firing frequency.\n\nIn the context of astrocytoma and peritumoral neuronal dysfunction, dysregulation of voltage-gated ion channels contributes critically to altered excitability. The peritumoral neurons adjacent to astrocytomas exhibit increased intrinsic excitability characterized by higher firing frequency slopes and enhanced sensitivity to depolarizing inputs[26]. Computational modeling of human cortical pyramidal neurons demonstrates that even modest increases in dendritic spine density, which occur in tumor-adjacent tissue, substantially augment voltage deflections at the soma through enhanced synaptic conductance, thereby lowering the threshold for action potential initiation[26]. This enhanced intrinsic excitability may reflect compensatory upregulation of calcium-dependent potassium channels attempting to stabilize firing, or alternatively, downregulation of M-channels and other hyperpolarizing conductances that would normally suppress excessive firing. The shift toward greater excitability is particularly pronounced in early-phase tumor growth (around 14 days post-injection in rodent models) and precedes clinical seizure manifestation, suggesting that this represents an early biomarker of tumor-associated hyperexcitability[26].\n\nFurthermore, the reactivation of developmental patterns of ion channel expression in glial tumors may contribute to the reported neuronal differentiation and plasticity of certain astrocytoma subsets. Specifically, low-grade astrocytomas (WHO grade II) express higher levels of neuronal differentiation markers, and the developmental programs governing neuronal identity specification involve coordinated changes in ion channel expression patterns. The presence of altered calcium and potassium channel expression in astrocytomas could reflect either incomplete neuronal differentiation of tumor cells or aberrant reactivation of developmental gene programs in neural stem cells undergoing malignant transformation.\n\n### Program 4: Axon Guidance and Neuronal Migration\n\nThe axon guidance program encompasses a diverse set of genes encoding guidance cues (SEMA3C, axon guidance receptors ROBO1, ROBO2, DCC, UNC5D), cell adhesion molecules (CHL1, CNTNAP2, CNTN5, SEZ6L, SEZ6L2), and secreted guidance factors. These genes function to direct axonal projections during development and maintain circuit connectivity in the adult brain through mechanisms involving both repulsive and attractive signaling. SEMA3C encodes semaphorin-3C, a secreted repulsive guidance molecule that signals through plexin receptors to collapse axonal growth cones and divert axons away from inhibitory regions[22]. ROBO1 and ROBO2 encode roundabout guidance receptors that bind Slit ligands and mediate repulsive axon guidance, playing crucial roles in both commissural axon crossing and lateral position-dependent axon guidance[29][31].\n\nDCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) and UNC5D function as receptors for netrin guidance signals, with DCC mediating attractive guidance responses and UNC5D capable of functioning as a co-receptor that converts netrin signaling from attractive to repulsive depending on the presence of additional signals[31]. The cell adhesion molecules CNTNAP2, CNTN5, and SEZ6L/L2 provide homophilic and heterophilic adhesive interactions that stabilize axon-axon contacts and promote fasciculation, organizing developing axonal tracts into coherent fiber bundles. CHL1 (cell adhesion molecule L1-like) mediates neuron-neuron and neuron-glia interactions critical for axon outgrowth and myelination.\n\nThe significance of this program in astrocytoma pathogenesis extends beyond developmental roles. Glioblastomas exhibit a striking ability to infiltrate the surrounding brain parenchyma by migrating along white matter tracts and co-opting the existing axonal scaffold. Recent studies using human iPSC-derived neural spheroids demonstrate that patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines (GBM20 and GBM1) migrate directionally along axons toward neural spheroids in live imaging assays, with infiltration patterns distinct from non-cancerous neural stem cells[27]. This directional migration along axons suggests that glioma cells exploit the guidance cues and adhesive landscape established by axon guidance molecules. Furthermore, the expression of axon guidance receptors like ROBO1 and ROBO2 in tumor cells may confer enhanced migratory capacity, allowing gliomas to navigate tissue spaces using the same molecular guidance cues that direct normal developmental axon migration.\n\nResearch on low-grade gliomas demonstrates that differential expression of axon guidance genes correlates with tumor infiltration patterns and prognosis. For example, SLIT-ROBO signaling suppression in gastric cancer promotes migration, suggesting that loss or downregulation of repulsive guidance pathways in astrocytomas could enhance infiltrative behavior[31]. Additionally, netrin-DCC signaling shows complex context-dependent effects in cancer, with pathway disruption potentially contributing to both reduced cell-cell adhesion and enhanced directional migration. The peritumoral cortex in glioblastoma also shows altered expression of guidance molecules and their receptors, which may reflect both reactive responses to tumor presence and selection for tumor cells capable of navigating this altered microenvironment.\n\n### Program 5: Postsynaptic Scaffolding and Synaptic Organization\n\nThe postsynaptic scaffolding program comprises genes encoding postsynaptic density (PSD) scaffolding proteins including DLG2, ANKS1B, MAGI3, LRRTM4, SHANK2, and GRIN2B (as a receptor anchoring point). These proteins organize the dense proteinaceous matrix underlying the postsynaptic membrane, coordinating the positioning and stabilization of neurotransmitter receptors, signaling enzymes, and adhesion molecules. DLG2 encodes PSD-93, a membrane-associated guanylate kinase that anchors NMDA receptors through interaction with the PSD-95 family and scaffolds numerous signaling complexes. ANKS1B encodes ankyrin repeat and sterile alpha motif-containing 1B, which localizes to dendritic spines and interacts with postsynaptic proteins to organize spine morphology and synaptic strength[16]. MAGI3 encodes membrane-associated guanylate kinase inverted 3, which interacts with postsynaptic proteins and has emerging roles in both synaptic plasticity and cell proliferation[16].\n\nLRRTM4 (leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal 4) functions as a postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule and interacts with presynaptic neurexins to establish trans-synaptic connections, providing both adhesive coupling and signaling across the synaptic cleft. SHANK2 encodes a scaffold protein that interacts with Homer proteins and helps nucleate the assembly of the postsynaptic density, organizing multivalent protein-protein interactions that stabilize synaptic strength. These scaffolding proteins collectively ensure that synaptic transmission is efficient, plastic, and responsive to activity-dependent regulation.\n\nIn the context of astrocytoma, the postsynaptic scaffolding program reflects the complex reorganization of peritumoral neuronal circuits. The increased dendritic spine density observed in glioma-adjacent neurons must be accompanied by assembly of new postsynaptic densities, requiring coordinated upregulation or redeployment of scaffolding proteins. Recent studies using advanced imaging and proteomic approaches have identified altered postsynaptic nanostructure in models of neurodevelopmental disorders featuring synaptic dysfunction, and similar alterations likely occur in tumor-associated neuronal remodeling[16]. The fact that DLG2 and related MAGUK family proteins regulate both synaptic function and cell proliferation suggests potential functional links between aberrant synaptic organization and tumor-cell proliferation signals, particularly in low-grade gliomas that express neuronal differentiation markers.\n\nFurthermore, mutations in scaffolding protein genes have been implicated in autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, conditions characterized by synaptic dysfunction and altered circuit connectivity. The reorganization of postsynaptic scaffolding in peritumoral neurons may therefore reflect both adaptive responses to tumor-derived signals and maladaptive consequences of chronic exposure to tumor-secreted factors. Specifically, the tumor microenvironment's inflammatory milieu and altered growth factor signaling may disrupt the normal developmental programs that assemble and maintain postsynaptic densities, leading to progressive destabilization of synaptic contacts.\n\n### Program 6: RNA Splicing Regulation and Neuronal Development\n\nThe RNA splicing regulation program comprises genes encoding splicing factors and regulators including SRRM4, RBFOX1, and CELF4, which control alternative splicing patterns critical for neuronal development, plasticity, and disease states. SRRM4 (serine and arginine-rich matrix protein 4) encodes a neuronal-specific splicing regulator that promotes the inclusion of neuron-specific exons and drives the conversion of neuronal precursors toward a differentiated neuronal fate[35]. SRRM4 functions by recognizing specific RNA sequences and recruiting the spliceosome to include neuron-specific exons while excluding embryonic or alternative isoforms. Mutations in SRRM4 have minor phenotypic effects on zebrafish neural development, suggesting functional redundancy or compensation by related factors[35].\n\nRBFOX1 (RNA binding fox-1 homolog 1), also known as FOX1 or ataxin-2-binding protein 1, is a splicing factor highly conserved among vertebrates and expressed in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, where it regulates alternative splicing and contributes to normal development and function[8][11]. RBFOX1 controls the alternative splicing of numerous neuronal genes and has emerged as a critical regulator of stress response mechanisms through its effects on BDNF/TRKB signaling. Loss of function of RBFOX1 leads to disrupted BDNF and TRKB expression, elevated stress hormone levels, and altered behavioral responses to stress, implicating this gene in psychiatric disease vulnerability[8]. In the context of astrocytoma, dysregulation of RBFOX1 and related splicing factors may alter the balance between pro-survival and pro-death isoforms of critical genes, thereby influencing both tumor cell and peritumoral neuron responses to stress.\n\nCELF4 encodes a CUGBP Elav-like family member that regulates alternative splicing and is particularly important during neuronal development[35]. The coordinated control of splicing during brain development relies on developmental changes in splicing factor expression, with SRSF1 and SRSF6 (members of the SR protein family) showing progressive decline in expression during brain maturation, correlating with characteristic patterns of developmental alternative splicing. Ultraconserved regions (UCRs) in the genome appear to regulate splicing factor genes through incorporation of poison exons that trigger nonsense-mediated decay of transcripts, providing a feedback mechanism for fine-tuning splicing regulator levels during development[35].\n\nIn astrocytoma biology, dysregulation of the splicing program is particularly significant because low-grade astrocytomas often maintain expression of neural stem cell-associated genes and exhibit incomplete differentiation. The developmental programs that drive splicing factor expression changes could be disrupted in glial tumors, leading to aberrant retention of embryonic isoforms or production of non-canonical protein variants lacking essential domains. Furthermore, the finding that INSM1, a transcription factor governing intermediate progenitor cell identity, is highly expressed in glioblastoma and drives a neuronal progenitor program that is essential for tumor pathogenesis[3] suggests that developmental transcriptional networks including those controlling splicing factor expression are reactivated in malignant gliomas. This reactivation of developmental splicing programs would be expected to promote expression of developmental isoforms of ion channels, receptors, and structural proteins, fundamentally altering the functional properties of tumor cells and peritumoral neurons.\n\n### Program 7: Cytoskeletal Dynamics and Dendritic Morphology\n\nThe cytoskeletal dynamics and dendritic morphology program encompasses genes encoding cytoskeletal regulators and linking proteins including ANK3, ABLIM2, VAV3, DYNC1I1, SPTBN4, and PAK5. ANK3 encodes ankyrin-3, a member of the ankyrin family of proteins that link integral membrane proteins to the underlying spectrin-actin cytoskeleton[13]. Ankyrins serve as crucial determinants of cell morphology, establishing and maintaining the organized cytoskeletal networks that underlie dendritic and axonal structure. ABLIM2 encodes actin-binding LIM protein 2, which modulates actin cytoskeleton organization and influences dendritic morphology through effects on actin polymerization and crosslinking. VAV3 encodes a Rho-family GTPase exchange factor that regulates cytoskeletal dynamics by promoting nucleotide exchange on Rac1 and related small GTPases, thereby controlling actin polymerization and dendritic spine morphology[21].\n\nDYNC1I1 encodes dynein heavy chain 1, the catalytic subunit of cytoplasmic dynein, which transports vesicles and organelles along microtubules. SPTBN4 encodes spectrin beta chain non-erythrocytic 4, providing structural support for the neuronal cytoskeleton and maintaining cell morphology. PAK5 encodes p21-activated kinase 5, which functions downstream of Rho GTPases to regulate cytoskeletal remodeling and dendritic spine morphology through phosphorylation of downstream effectors including LIMK and cofilin, which modify actin filament dynamics.\n\nThe significance of this program in astrocytoma is multifold. First, the enhanced dendritic spine density and altered dendritic morphology observed in glioma-adjacent neurons require active cytoskeletal remodeling. The increased spine density and altered geometry of spines and dendrites in tumor-adjacent pyramidal neurons reflect both de novo spine formation and remodeling of existing structures, processes that are fundamentally dependent on coordinated actin polymerization, microtubule dynamics, and linker protein function. Second, glioma cell migration and infiltration into surrounding tissue requires extensive cytoskeletal remodeling to enable dynamic changes in cell shape and adhesive properties. Dysregulation of Rho GTPase signaling and PAK kinase activity in glioma cells promotes a mesenchymal phenotype associated with enhanced motility and invasiveness[6].\n\nRecent research demonstrates that loss of pericytes in the glioma perivascular niche leads to remodeling of the microenvironment and expansion of a mesenchymal glioma cell state[6][52]. This mesenchymal transformation is characterized by altered cytoskeletal organization and upregulation of signaling pathways promoting cell motility. The genes in this program, particularly PAK5 and VAV3, function as effectors downstream of chemotactic receptors and contribute to directed migration. Furthermore, the fact that PAK and Rho GTPase signaling intersects with both cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular proliferation raises the possibility that aberrant activation of these pathways in astrocytomas drives both tumor cell motility and cell cycle progression.\n\n### Program 8: Extracellular Matrix Interactions and Cell Adhesion\n\nThe extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions program comprises genes encoding ECM proteins (FRAS1, EDIL3, NELL1), cell adhesion molecules (TENM2, FAM155A, NTM, CHL1), and secreted signaling molecules that mediate interactions between cells and the ECM. FRAS1 encodes Fraser syndrome-associated protein 1, an ECM component important for tissue adhesion and structural organization. EDIL3 encodes EGF-like repeats and discoidin domains 3, an ECM protein involved in cell-cell interactions and vascular development. NELL1 encodes NEL-like molecule 1, which is upregulated during osteoblast differentiation and has emerging roles in neuronal development and circuit plasticity[27].\n\nTENM2 (teneurin-2) encodes a transmembrane protein involved in cell-cell recognition and axon guidance, functioning as both a trans-synaptic adhesion molecule and a regulator of circuit organization. FAM155A encodes a familial adenomatous polyposis-associated protein with potential roles in developmental cell-cell interactions. NTM encodes neurotrimin, a membrane-anchored glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions and known to interact with other CAMs to regulate neuronal migration and axon outgrowth. These ECM and adhesion molecules collectively establish the cellular scaffold that organizes tissue architecture and specifies cell-cell contacts.\n\nIn the context of astrocytoma pathogenesis, spatial transcriptomic profiling has revealed that ECM signaling pathways are extensively dysregulated in glioblastoma compared to normal brain[24][55]. The ECM expression signatures differ markedly between different GBM cell populations and stromal cell types, with vascular endothelial cells and microglia/macrophages showing largely non-overlapping ECM gene expression patterns[24][55]. This spatial organization of ECM expression reflects the complex microarchitecture of glioblastomas, where distinct cellular niches express different sets of ECM components to support different cellular populations and functional states. The perivascular niche, which is enriched for tumor-supporting immune cells, exhibits characteristic ECM signatures distinct from hypoxic regions or infiltrating tumor fronts.\n\nFurthermore, computational analysis of ECM ligand-receptor networks has identified novel interactions between glioma cells and stromal cells mediated by ECM molecules. The dysregulation of ECM components in astrocytomas is particularly significant because it affects not only tumor cell-stromal interactions but also peritumoral neuron-ECM interactions. Altered ECM composition in the tumor microenvironment would be expected to disrupt normal synaptic stability through effects on perisynaptic matrix composition and structure, thereby contributing to the dendritic spine destabilization and synaptic reorganization observed in tumor-adjacent neurons. Additionally, certain ECM molecules like L1CAM (L1 cell adhesion molecule) have been shown to promote glioma cell migration, suggesting that tumor-derived remodeling of the local ECM landscape actively supports infiltrative behavior[37].\n\n### Program 9: Neurotrophic Signaling and Growth Factor Cascades\n\nThe neurotrophic signaling program comprises genes encoding receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands that mediate growth factor signaling critical for neuronal survival, plasticity, and circuit development. Key components include ERBB4 (ErbB-4 receptor tyrosine kinase), NRG1 and NRG3 (neuregulin ligands), BDNF targets (implied through the effects of genes like RBFOX1 that regulate BDNF/TRKB signaling), and downstream signaling molecules. ERBB4 encodes the ErbB-4 receptor tyrosine kinase that binds neuregulin ligands and activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades[17]. ERBB4 is expressed in parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneurons and plays a critical role in interneuron development, survival, and functional integration into cortical circuits.\n\nNRG1 and NRG3 encode members of the neuregulin family of growth factors that signal through ErbB receptors. NRG1 is particularly important for myelination, axon-glia interactions, and synaptic plasticity, with mutations in NRG1 associated with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric conditions[19]. The NRG1-ErbB signaling pathway regulates interneuron migration, differentiation, and synaptic function, and dysregulation of this pathway contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders and potentially to synaptic dysfunction in peritumoral contexts.\n\nIn astrocytoma biology, dysregulation of neurotrophic signaling contributes to multiple aspects of tumor pathogenesis and peritumoral neuron dysfunction. First, altered neurotrophic factor signaling in the tumor microenvironment promotes the survival and expansion of tumor-supporting cell populations, including alternatively activated macrophages and regulatory T cells. Second, the aberrant expression of growth factor receptors and ligands in astrocytomas themselves drives proliferation and survival of tumor cells. Third, peritumoral neurons exposed to altered neurotrophic signaling may undergo adaptive or maladaptive responses that either promote tumor progression or contribute to progressive neuronal dysfunction and loss. Recent studies have identified altered signaling through multiple receptor tyrosine kinase pathways in pediatric high-grade gliomas, including NTRK (neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor) fusion events that drive oncogenic kinase activation[43]. These findings highlight the central role of neurotrophic signaling in glioma biology and point to ERBB4 and related receptors as potential therapeutic targets.\n\nFurthermore, the neuregulin-ErbB signaling pathway regulates the conversion between different microglial activation states, with NRG1-ErbB4 signaling promoting conversion from pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage to anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype through inhibition of NF-kappaB pathway activation[17]. This finding suggests that dysregulation of NRG1-ERBB4 signaling in astrocytomas may contribute to the skewing of immune cells toward tumor-supporting phenotypes, thereby creating a permissive microenvironment for tumor growth.\n\n### Program 10: Transcriptional Regulation of Neuronal Identity and Differentiation\n\nThe transcriptional regulation program comprises genes encoding transcription factors and chromatin-associated proteins that control neuronal identity specification, differentiation, and maintenance of neuronal gene expression programs. While the input gene list includes relatively few direct transcription factor genes, the effects of genes like RBFOX1, SRRM4, and others on transcriptional networks through splicing regulation make this a critical functional category. Indirect evidence suggests roles for transcription factors in controlling programs that encompass the other gene lists. Recent research on glioblastoma demonstrates that a transcription factor-driven intermediate progenitor cell-like state, driven by INSM1, governs plasticity and tumorigenicity[3].\n\nINSM1 is highly expressed in human glioblastoma tumors and, during cortical development, specifically in intermediate progenitor cells that give rise to neurons. Remarkably, INSM1 knockdown in triple mutant neural stem cells and primary glioblastoma cells disrupts oncogenic gene expression and function and inhibits the in vivo tumorigenicity of triple mutant neural stem cells, highlighting the functional importance of an intermediate progenitor cell-like cell state in glioblastoma pathogenesis[3]. This finding points to a fundamental principle: that malignant gliomas exploit developmental gene regulatory networks to maintain plasticity and prevent terminal differentiation.\n\nThe dysregulation of splicing factors like SRRM4 and RBFOX1 likely contributes to altered transcriptional program execution through multiple mechanisms. First, these splicing regulators control the production of functional versus non-functional isoforms of transcription factors, thereby modulating their activity. Second, through effects on the splicing of histone-modifying enzymes and chromatin remodelers, they indirectly affect the chromatin landscape and transcriptional accessibility. Third, they regulate splicing of genes involved in feedback regulation of developmental programs, thereby affecting the robustness and flexibility of cell fate specification.\n\nIn the context of low-grade versus high-grade astrocytomas, the balance between differentiation and dedifferentiation appears to be controlled by similar transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory networks. IDH-mutant low-grade astrocytomas (WHO grade II) maintain higher expression of neural stem cell markers and show incomplete oligodendroglial differentiation, suggesting that developmental programs are partially activated or that terminal differentiation programs are blocked. Conversely, high-grade astrocytomas (WHO grade III-IV) often show markers of lineage infidelity and expression of neuronal markers alongside glial markers, suggesting a state of mixed or failed differentiation.\n\n---\n\n## Integration of Gene Programs in Astrocytoma Pathogenesis\n\nThe ten gene programs identified through this analysis collectively illuminate the complex biology of astrocytoma and its relationship to normal neural development. At the most fundamental level, astrocytomas represent malignant transformations of glial precursors or mature astrocytes, yet many of these tumors exhibit aberrant expression of neuronal genes and neuronal developmental programs. The presence of 201 neuronal-related genes in the input list likely reflects this hallmark feature: the dysregulation of developmental plasticity programs in tumor cells and their impacts on peritumoral neurons.\n\nThe glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission programs (Programs 1 and 2) highlight how malignant transformation disrupts the careful balance between excitation and inhibition in neural circuits. Glioma-adjacent neurons exhibit enhanced glutamatergic transmission and reduced GABAergic inhibition, leading to a state of hyperexcitability that predisposes to seizures. This hyperexcitability is not simply a passive consequence of tumor mass effect or inflammation; rather, it results from active reorganization of synaptic structure and function, as evidenced by increased dendritic spine density and altered expression of receptors and signaling molecules. The computational modeling showing that modest increases in dendritic spine density can double spike outputs and dramatically increase seizure susceptibility[26] indicates that even relatively small changes in synaptic organization can have profound functional consequences.\n\nThe ion channel program (Program 3) provides the cellular-level determinants of intrinsic excitability. The shift toward higher firing frequencies and enhanced sensitivity to depolarizing inputs observed in glioma-adjacent neurons likely reflects dysregulation of voltage-gated calcium and potassium channels. Some of these changes may represent homeostatic compensation for elevated synaptic drive, while others may reflect direct effects of tumor-secreted factors or inflammatory mediators. The important point is that dysregulation of multiple components of the ion channel program collectively shift neuronal excitability toward a pathological state.\n\nThe axon guidance program (Program 4) reveals how tumors exploit developmental mechanisms to infiltrate surrounding tissue and migrate along existing fiber tracts. Gliomas co-opt the axon guidance landscape established during development, using the same molecular cues that normally direct neurons to navigate their environment. The directional migration of patient-derived glioblastoma cells along axons in vitro[27] demonstrates that this is an active, molecularly-mediated process rather than passive migration. Furthermore, the targeting of axon guidance genes (particularly ROBO2 and related receptors) in glioma therapy could potentially disrupt this infiltrative behavior.\n\nThe postsynaptic scaffolding program (Program 5) reflects the need for coordinated assembly of new synapses in response to tumor-derived signals. The increased dendritic spine density in glioma-adjacent neurons requires not only enhanced glutamatergic signaling but also organized assembly of postsynaptic densities. This active synaptic remodeling is energetically expensive and may contribute to metabolic stress in peritumoral neurons. Furthermore, the link between scaffolding proteins and cell proliferation raises the possibility that similar signaling complexes promote both synaptic plasticity and tumor cell proliferation.\n\nThe RNA splicing program (Program 6) occupies a unique position in this analysis because dysregulation of splicing factors like SRRM4 and RBFOX1 can globally reprogram gene expression through coordinated changes in alternative splicing. The developmental decline in splicing factor expression during normal brain maturation is disrupted in gliomas, leading to aberrant production of embryonic versus adult isoforms of critical genes. This global reprogram would have cascading effects on all other functional programs, making the splicing program potentially the most powerful point of intervention.\n\nThe cytoskeletal dynamics program (Program 7) is essential for both tumor cell migration and peritumoral neuron remodeling. Dysregulation of small GTPases like Rac1 and their effectors like PAK kinases drives the cytoskeletal changes necessary for migration and infiltration. Furthermore, activity in this program intersects with oncogenic signaling cascades, suggesting links between structural remodeling and proliferation control.\n\nThe ECM interactions program (Program 8) reflects the complex tissue remodeling that occurs during tumor growth and progression. The dysregulation of ECM components in different spatial compartments of the tumor suggests that the tumor microenvironment is actively partitioned into distinct niches with specific molecular signatures. These ECM differences would profoundly affect both tumor cell interactions with stromal cells and peritumoral neuron interactions with their microenvironment.\n\nThe neurotrophic signaling program (Program 9) connects cell-cell communication through growth factors to both tumor cell proliferation and peritumoral neuron dysfunction. Aberrant neurotrophic signaling in the tumor microenvironment drives immune cell polarization, vascular remodeling, and potentially contributes to the loss of neurotrophic support for peritumoral neurons. The identification of NTRK fusion events in pediatric high-grade gliomas highlights the pathogenic role of constitutively active neurotrophic receptor signaling.\n\nFinally, the transcriptional regulation program (Program 10) integrates all other programs through coordinated control of gene expression. The reactivation of developmental transcriptional networks, particularly those governing intermediate progenitor cell identity (through INSM1), appears to be a core mechanism driving glioma plasticity and tumorigenicity. Understanding how these developmental programs are reactivated in somatic mutations would provide crucial insight into glioma pathogenesis.\n\n---\n\n## Connectivity and Cross-Talk Between Gene Programs\n\nThe programs described above do not operate in isolation; rather, they are tightly integrated through multiple layers of molecular interaction and functional feedback. Understanding these connections is essential for comprehending how dysregulation at the gene level translates into cellular and tissue-level dysfunction in astrocytoma contexts.\n\nThe synaptic transmission programs (glutamatergic and GABAergic) are fundamentally linked through circuit-level interactions and through shared postsynaptic signaling infrastructure. Both programs funnel their signals through postsynaptic calcium handling mechanisms, with both NMDA receptors (Program 1) and GABA-B receptors (Program 2) modulating intracellular calcium. The postsynaptic scaffolding program (Program 5) provides the organizational framework for both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic machinery, ensuring that glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs are spatially organized and capable of integrating at the level of the postsynaptic compartment. This integration is absolutely essential for maintaining excitatory-inhibitory balance, and its disruption in glioma-adjacent neurons contributes directly to hyperexcitability and seizure susceptibility[26][33].\n\nThe ion channel program (Program 3) is intimately connected to the synaptic transmission programs through activity-dependent regulation. The calcium influx through NMDA receptors (Program 1) and the membrane potential changes driven by GABAergic transmission (Program 2) both directly modulate the voltage-dependent gating of ion channels. Furthermore, the calcium-activated potassium channels (KCNMA1, KCNMB2 in Program 3) provide feedback inhibition of neuronal firing in response to calcium influx, creating a homeostatic mechanism. Dysregulation of any component of this interconnected system would destabilize the entire circuit.\n\nThe RNA splicing program (Program 6) functionally integrates all other programs through its control of alternative splicing of genes in every category. For example, RBFOX1-regulated splicing controls the inclusion of exons in BDNF and TRKB (neurotrophic signaling, Program 9), in PAC1 receptor isoforms that influence stress response and downstream signaling[8], and potentially in ion channels and receptors from other programs. Similarly, SRRM4-controlled splicing drives the inclusion of neuron-specific exons in many genes while excluding embryonic isoforms, thereby controlling the execution of the neuronal developmental program at a post-transcriptional level. This splicing program is particularly important in astrocytomas because low-grade tumors often maintain partially differentiated states that may reflect dysregulation of developmental splicing programs.\n\nThe axon guidance program (Program 4) functionally connects to the postsynaptic scaffolding program (Program 5) through trans-synaptic adhesion molecules like LRRTM4 (included in Program 5) that interact with presynaptic neurexins to stabilize developing synapses. The same guidance cues that direct axonal projections during development (Program 4) also function in axon-target matching and synapse selection, meaning that dysregulation of guidance molecules could simultaneously disrupt both circuit wiring and synaptic efficacy.\n\nThe cytoskeletal dynamics program (Program 7) is upstream of the postsynaptic scaffolding program (Program 5) in the sense that cytoskeletal reorganization through Rho GTPase signaling (including VAV3) directly drives dendritic spine morphogenesis and thereby enables assembly of new postsynaptic densities. Conversely, the postsynaptic scaffolding proteins interact with cytoskeletal regulatory proteins, providing mechanical links that stabilize spine structure. Dysregulation of either program would disrupt the delicate balance between spine stability and plasticity.\n\nThe ECM interactions program (Program 8) physically surrounds and constrains neurons and synapses, influencing both synaptic transmission (Programs 1, 2) through perisynaptic matrix components and axon guidance (Program 4) through substrate-bound cues. The spatial organization of different ECM molecules in distinct compartments of gliomas[24][55] likely reflects differential regulation of genes in this program in response to tumor-specific signals.\n\nThe neurotrophic signaling program (Program 9) integrates across all other programs through receptor tyrosine kinase signaling that modulates virtually every aspect of neuronal function. ERBB4 signaling through NRG1/NRG3 ligands affects synaptic transmission, dendritic morphology, interneuron migration, and immune cell function, highlighting the pleiotropic effects of disrupted neurotrophic signaling in the tumor context.\n\nFinally, the transcriptional regulation program (Program 10) sits at the apex of this hierarchical organization, controlling the coordinated expression of genes from all other programs. The reactivation of developmental transcriptional networks in gliomas leads to coordinated re-expression of developmental gene isoforms, developmental levels of ion channels, developmental patterns of synaptic connectivity, and developmental cell-cell interactions. This wholesale reactivation of developmental programs is likely a core mechanism through which gliomas achieve the remarkable plasticity that allows them to maintain malignancy despite therapeutic pressure.\n\n---\n\n## Implications for Understanding Astrocytoma Subtypes and Heterogeneity\n\nThe presence of all ten gene programs and their complex inter-connections suggests that astrocytoma biology reflects both tumor-intrinsic dysregulation of developmental programs and responses of the surrounding tissue to tumor-derived signals. The remarkable heterogeneity of astrocytomas—particularly the wide range of grades from low-grade (WHO II) to high-grade (WHO III-IV)—likely reflects differences in the extent and specificity of dysregulation of these programs.\n\nLow-grade astrocytomas typically maintain higher expression of neural stem cell markers and show incomplete oligodendroglial differentiation, suggesting that programs related to neuronal and glial development remain partially active. In this context, the genes from the input list would be expected to show elevated expression, particularly those involved in developmental processes like axon guidance (Program 4) and RNA splicing regulation (Program 6). The relatively slow growth and extended survival seen in low-grade astrocytomas may reflect the tumor's attempt to maintain developmental plasticity while partially engaging differentiation programs.\n\nHigh-grade astrocytomas show mixed expression of glial and neuronal markers, indicative of profound dysregulation of the transcriptional regulation program (Program 10) and its effects on all downstream programs. These tumors often exhibit enhanced expression of mesenchymal transformation markers and reduced expression of differentiation markers, suggesting that Programs 7 (cytoskeletal dynamics) and 9 (neurotrophic signaling) are particularly dysregulated. The rapid growth and high lethality of high-grade astrocytomas may reflect complete decoupling from developmental constraints and constitutive activation of proliferation and migration programs.\n\nThe spatial heterogeneity of glioblastomas, with distinct cell populations and states identified through single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses[3][55], likely reflects differential expression of genes from the input list in different tumor compartments. For example, tumor cells in hypoxic regions might show elevated expression of metabolic adaptation genes and reduced expression of synaptic programs, while tumor cells in the perivascular niche show enhanced expression of neurotrophic signaling genes and adhesion molecules. The identification of a neuronal progenitor-like state driven by INSM1 that confers tumorigenicity[3] suggests that reactivation of developmental transcriptional programs in distinct tumor subpopulations drives the most aggressive phenotypes.\n\n---\n\n## Therapeutic Implications\n\nThe comprehensive analysis of these ten gene programs reveals multiple potential therapeutic intervention points. Broadly, therapies could target: (1) dysregulation of synaptic programs to reduce peritumoral neuron excitability and seizure susceptibility; (2) reactivation of developmental transcriptional programs through targeting of factors like INSM1; (3) dysregulated axon guidance signaling to prevent tumor cell migration and infiltration; (4) aberrant neurotrophic signaling to deprive tumors of growth-promoting signals and alter immune cell phenotypes; and (5) RNA splicing dysregulation through splicing factor inhibition.\n\nRecent progress in understanding the structure and regulation of synaptic programs has enabled development of approaches to selectively enhance GABAergic inhibition or reduce glutamatergic transmission, both of which could improve seizure outcomes in tumor patients[26]. Furthermore, the finding that postoperative seizures can be predicted based on preoperative peritumoral neuronal properties[26] suggests that interventions targeting these programs could be implemented before seizure onset to prevent this major complication of tumor surgery and progression.\n\nThe discovery that intermediate progenitor-like states driven by INSM1 are essential for glioma tumorigenicity[3] points to therapeutic strategies targeting this developmental program. INSM1 knockdown leads to disruption of oncogenic gene expression and reduced tumorigenicity, suggesting that small-molecule or biologic approaches to inhibit INSM1 function could be effective. Similarly, targeting of the RNA splicing program through inhibition of SRRM4 or other splicing factors could globally reprogram gene expression and potentially force glioma cells to undergo terminal differentiation or apoptosis.\n\nThe role of dysfunctional pericyte-macrophage interactions in promoting glioma growth[6][52] suggests that therapies targeting neurotrophic signaling pathways could have dual effects: directly suppressing tumor proliferation and simultaneously shifting immune cells away from tumor-supporting phenotypes. Recent work identifying mesenchymal transformation as a consequence of pericyte loss points to combined pericyte replacement or stabilization therapies as potential approaches.\n\nFinally, the dysregulation of axon guidance programs in promoting glioma infiltration suggests that blocking ROBO-SLIT or netrin-DCC signaling could potentially impede tumor cell migration along white matter tracts, thereby limiting infiltration and potentially improving surgical resectability.\n\n---\n\n## Limitations and Future Directions\n\nThis analysis, while comprehensive, is limited by the necessarily incomplete state of knowledge regarding how individual genes function in the specific context of astrocytoma. While the input gene list contains genes known to be involved in synaptic transmission, axon guidance, and neural development, the specific roles of many of these genes in astrocytoma biology remain incompletely characterized. Future work combining single-cell transcriptomics with functional perturbation experiments will be essential for understanding how dysregulation of individual genes contributes to the overall astrocytoma phenotype.\n\nAdditionally, the analysis emphasizes that gene programs are not isolated entities but exist within an interconnected network of functional dependencies. Understanding these networks will require integrative approaches combining genomics, proteomics, and functional studies to map the full wiring diagram of astrocytoma biology. The remarkable plasticity and heterogeneity of these tumors likely reflect different configurations of these gene programs in distinct tumor subpopulations, suggesting that single-cell approaches combined with spatial profiling will be essential for comprehensive understanding.\n\nFinally, while this analysis focused on tumor-intrinsic dysregulation of gene programs, astrocytoma biology is fundamentally shaped by interactions between tumor and stromal cells in the microenvironment. Future research should integrate tumor-cell transcriptomics with single-cell analysis of immune cells, vascular cells, and other stromal components to understand how programs in one cell type influence program execution in others.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis comprehensive analysis of 201 genes in the context of astrocytoma biology identified ten major functional gene programs organized around core biological functions including synaptic transmission, ion channel regulation, axon guidance, postsynaptic scaffolding, cytoskeletal dynamics, RNA splicing, extracellular matrix interactions, neurotrophic signaling, and transcriptional regulation. These programs are deeply interconnected through multiple regulatory feedback loops and functional dependencies, collectively controlling the complex process of neuronal circuit development and plasticity.\n\nIn astrocytoma, dysregulation of these gene programs contributes to multiple aspects of tumor pathogenesis and progression. At the tumor-cell level, reactivation of developmental transcriptional networks drives plasticity and tumorigenicity while enabling infiltration through co-optation of axon guidance mechanisms. At the peritumoral level, altered synaptic transmission, dendritic remodeling, and neuronal excitability lead to circuit dysfunction and seizure susceptibility. The spatial heterogeneity of glioblastomas reflects differential expression of genes from these programs in distinct tumor compartments and cellular niches.\n\nUnderstanding these gene programs and their dysregulation in astrocytoma provides both mechanistic insight into tumor biology and suggests multiple therapeutic intervention points. Emerging evidence from recent studies, particularly the identification of intermediate progenitor-like states driven by INSM1 and the characterization of pericyte-mediated tumor restraint, points to the importance of developmental programs and microenvironmental interactions in determining tumor fate.
