When analyzed within the context of astrocytoma—a glial tumor that can arise from neural progenitor cells and involves profound alterations in differentiation state, cell-cell interactions, and electrophysiological properties—these genes cluster into distinct functional programs that collectively illuminate both the molecular foundations of tumor cell plasticity and the mechanisms driving perilesional neuronal dysfunction. This report integrates findings from recent literature to identify coherent gene programs, evaluate their relevance to astrocytoma pathogenesis, and highlight the critical interplay between developmental programs and oncogenic transformation. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that canonical glioblastoma mutations drive functional plasticity through the activation of intermediate progenitor cell-like states and the repression of mature differentiation programs, while simultaneously altering the microenvironment through changes in glutamate handling, astrocytic activation, and synaptic transmission in surrounding tissue.\n\n## Calcium Signaling and Electrophysiological Programming in Astrocytoma\n\n### Voltage-Gated Calcium Channel Architecture and Neuronal Excitability\n\nThe calcium signaling program represents one of the most extensively characterized molecular modules among the input genes, comprising multiple voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) subtypes and associated regulatory machinery. **CACNA1C**, which encodes the CaV1.2 L-type channel, is among the most multiply studied genes in the context of neuropsychiatric disease and represents a critical node in experience-dependent neuronal plasticity. Remarkably, the same CACNA1C mutations and variants associated with autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder through effects on dopamine-dependent learning also harbor implications for brain tumor biology. In the specific context of tumor-associated seizures and perilesional neuronal dysfunction, CaV1.2-mediated calcium influx serves as a crucial trigger for action potential-dependent synaptic transmission and dendritic integration.[8] Recent studies using photoactivatable Rac1 (PA-Rac1) have demonstrated that localized activation of Rac1 alone is sufficient to induce structural long-term potentiation in hippocampal synapses independently of CaMKII, suggesting that calcium-dependent actin dynamics represent a self-sustaining signaling module critical for synaptic memory encoding.[31] The relevance to astrocytoma becomes apparent when considering that perilesional neurons exhibit profound alterations in intrinsic electrophysiological properties, including enhanced excitability and altered dendritic morphology, phenomena that are mechanistically downstream of abnormal calcium signaling.[3] CACNA1D and CACNA1E encode additional L-type calcium channel subtypes with distinct tissue distributions and developmental roles, with CACNA1D playing particular roles in pacemaking activity and CACNA1E involved in dendritic calcium handling in specific neuronal populations.[11]\n\nThe **CaV1.2 phosphorylation program** emerges as especially relevant to understanding how glioma-driven changes in the peritumoral microenvironment culminate in seizure initiation. Computational simulations of human cortical neurons have revealed that these cells are highly susceptible to synaptic and dendritic perturbations that induce paroxysmal depolarizing shifts (PDS)—a pathological electrophysiological signature strongly predictive of seizure onset.[3] The dopaminergic modulation of CaV1.2 through D1/5 receptor signaling and cAMP-PKA pathways represents a canonical mechanism by which neuromodulatory tone influences neuronal excitability and learning-related synaptic plasticity.[8] Critically, glioma cells alter local dopamine levels and glutamate concentrations in the peritumoral cortex, thereby disrupting the normal dynamic range of calcium signaling that maintains network stability.[44] The phosphorylation of CaV1.2 at serine 1928 plays a central role in the improvement of working memory upon stimulation of D1/5 signaling,[8] suggesting that tumor-induced alterations in monoaminergic tone could fundamentally reprogram the ability of perilesional neurons to encode and retrieve spatial and contextual information while simultaneously predisposing the network to aberrant synchronous discharge.\n\n### Potassium Channel Dysfunction and Network Excitability\n\nThe potassium channel program comprises a complementary set of genes that collectively determine the repolarization kinetics and intrinsic excitability of neurons. **KCNQ3** encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel whose dysfunction is associated with neonatal epilepsy, and whose normal function is essential for setting the subthreshold excitability of neurons.[11] KCNC2 and KCNB2 encode distinct potassium channel subtypes involved in action potential repolarization and burst firing patterns, while **KCNJ3** encodes an inwardly-rectifying potassium channel gated by G-protein coupled receptors. The voltage clamp recordings from perilesional neurons in glioma-bearing mice reveal that the intrinsic properties of pyramidal neurons are substantially altered during early tumor progression, prior to seizure onset.[44] Notably, the upregulation of voltage-gated calcium channels coupled with the relative reduction in potassium channel activity would be expected to produce a pathological gain in excitability, a prediction supported by direct electrophysiological measurements in patient tissue from tumor-associated seizure (TAS) patients.[44] The coordinated dysregulation of multiple potassium channel genes would render neurons unable to maintain normal resting membrane potential and would amplify the propagation of excitatory inputs through the network.\n\n### NMDA Receptor Signaling and Synaptic Plasticity Gating\n\n**GRIN1** and **GRIN2B** encode the fundamental subunits of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which gate calcium entry during coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity and serve as molecular coincidence detectors underlying many forms of long-term potentiation.[9][12] The GRIN2B subunit imparts distinctive properties including slower channel kinetics, greater calcium permeability, and coupling to distinct downstream signaling cascades compared to GRIN2A.[15] Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of pyramidal neurons isolated from the peritumoral cortex of glioma patients reveals that TAS patients exhibit distinct transcriptional signatures involving upregulation of genes linked to neuronal homeostasis, synaptic transmission, and synaptic plasticity, with particular enrichment in NMDAR-related pathways.[3] Furthermore, glioma cells cause elevation of local glutamate concentration through disruption of the xCT transporter and impairment of glutamate reuptake mechanisms, thereby creating a pathological state of glutamate excitotoxicity that hyperactivates NMDA receptors and drives the generation of excessive calcium signals.[3][44] The computational models generated from human cortical neuron recordings indicate that even modest increases in synaptic strength at NMDAR-containing synapses, combined with dendritic perturbations, are sufficient to trigger PDS-like events that propagate through the network.[3]\n\n## Glutamatergic Synaptic Transmission and Receptor Trafficking\n\n### AMPA Receptor Composition and Synaptic Strength\n\n**GRIA1**, encoding GluA1, represents the primarily calcium-permeable AMPA receptor subunit dynamically trafficked during long-term potentiation, while the list also includes **GRIA2**, which encodes a subunit with altered calcium permeability that is more constitutively expressed at mature synapses.[15][60] The **GRIP1** and **GRIP2** genes encode PDZ domain proteins that serve as adaptor molecules linking AMPA receptors to the postsynaptic density scaffold complex through interaction with PSD-95 and related MAGUK proteins.[15] High-content imaging and proteomics approaches examining synaptic heterogeneity across hippocampal layers reveal that the relative abundance of GluA2-containing versus GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors shows significant layer-specific and circuit-specific variation, with profound functional consequences for short-term plasticity and information coding.[15] In the context of chronic dopamine depletion, a phenomenon relevant to glioma-induced alterations in monoaminergic tone, the postsynaptic insertion of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors is a hallmark of homeostatic synaptic plasticity that compensates for reduced presynaptic drive.[43] This homeostatic response involves the recruitment of activity-regulated proteins and the restructuring of the postsynaptic density to accommodate new receptor compositions.[15][41]\n\n### Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Signaling and Plasticity\n\n**GRM5** and **GRM7** encode group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) that couple to phospholipase C activation and calcium release from intracellular stores, providing a complementary pathway to NMDA receptor-mediated calcium signaling.[15] mGluR signaling is essential for certain forms of long-term depression (LTD) and drives the internalization of AMPA receptors through calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation and subsequent dephosphorylation events. Critically, the same phosphorylation cascades that regulate AMPA receptor trafficking are dysregulated in glioma cells, with several lines of evidence suggesting that tumor-derived factors, including transforming growth factor-beta and other cytokines, alter the phosphorylation state of key scaffolding proteins.[3] The fact that perilesional neurons exhibit both structural changes (increased dendritic spine density) and altered gene expression patterns consistent with enhanced synaptic plasticity suggests that the microenvironment surrounding gliomas reactivates developmental plasticity programs in mature neurons.[3]\n\n### Synaptic Scaffold Architecture and Postsynaptic Density Organization\n\nThe postsynaptic density (PSD) program encompasses a large family of scaffolding and signaling proteins that organize neurotransmitter receptors and link them to downstream effectors. **DLG2**, encoding PSD-93, and **DLG4** (PSD-95) are MAGUK proteins that organize the core structure of excitatory synapses by clustering NMDA and AMPA receptors while simultaneously serving as signaling hubs that integrate diverse calcium-dependent and kinase-dependent signals.[16][41][51] The critical finding that acute degradation of PSD-95 leads to concomitant loss of AMPA receptors from the same synapses, even in the presence of endogenous PSD-95 variants, indicates that the stoichiometric balance of scaffold components is essential for receptor stabilization.[41][51] Unexpectedly, acute degradation of GKAP (also known as SAPAP1, DLGAP1, and DLG2), rather than PSD-95, is associated with significant postsynaptic density shrinkage and efflux of PSD-95, suggesting a hierarchical organization in which GKAP acts as a primary driver of PSD architecture.[51] This distinction carries profound implications for understanding how tumor-derived perturbations of scaffold protein phosphorylation or expression could selectively alter receptor composition without triggering wholesale synapse loss.\n\n### Shank Complex-Mediated Dendritic Spine Architecture\n\n**SHANK2** encodes a core component of the SHANK family that serves as a membrane-distal scaffold protein forming multivalent interactions with GKAP and other PSD proteins to create a network-like architecture that extends from the postsynaptic membrane into the dendritic spine cytoplasm.[15][51] Loss-of-function mutations in SHANK genes are associated with autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability, implying that the precise organization of the SHANK-containing scaffold is essential for normal cognitive and social development.[15] The involvement of multiple SHANK-interacting proteins in the input gene list, including GKAP, PSD-95 and numerous regulatory kinases and phosphatases, suggests that the input gene list captures much of the molecular machinery required for dendritic spine formation and stabilization. Recent findings demonstrate that Rac1-mediated actin polymerization drives the enlargement of dendritic spines during structural long-term potentiation independently of the classical CaMKII-dependent pathway,[31] suggesting that multiple molecular modules can drive the same structural outcome through distinct signaling cascades. This mechanistic redundancy may explain why perilesional neurons retain the capacity for robust structural remodeling despite the profound alterations in their electrophysiological and molecular phenotype.\n\n## GABAergic Inhibitory Synaptic Transmission and Developmental Plasticity\n\n### Inhibitory Receptor Subtypes and Postsynaptic Organization\n\n**GABRB1** and **GABRG2** encode the β and γ subunits of GABAA receptors, respectively, which together with the α subunits determine the kinetics, single-channel conductance, and subcellular localization of inhibitory synapses.[41] **GABBR2** encodes the B2 subunit of GABA-B receptors, which are metabotropic receptors coupled to G-proteins that modulate presynaptic neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic hyperpolarization through activation of potassium channels.[15] The postsynaptic density of inhibitory synapses is organized around **gephyrin**, a multivalent scaffolding protein structurally homologous to GKAP that clusters GABA-A and glycine receptors and couples them to the cytoskeleton.[41][51] Critical experiments using acute gephyrin degradation have shown that rapid loss of gephyrin is followed by concomitant internalization of GABA-A receptors from postsynaptic membranes, indicating that the scaffolding protein directly stabilizes receptor localization.[41][51] The balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, often referred to as the E/I balance, is profoundly disrupted in both developmental disorders and in the context of brain tumors.[10] Recent findings in astrocyte-derived progenitor cells demonstrate that specific astrocyte subsets maintain the capacity to generate inhibitory interneurons through expression of intermediate progenitor transcription factors, suggesting that the astrocytic tumor microenvironment may partially reactivate developmental inhibitory neuron generation programs.[2]\n\n### Developmental GABAergic Neuron Generation and Circuit Assembly\n\nThe input gene list includes several genes that regulate the developmental specification of GABAergic interneurons. The transcription factor **MYT1L** (myelin transcription factor 1-like) is required for neuronal differentiation and acts as a master regulator of the neuronal transcriptional program by repressing glial genes and activating neuronal genes.[52] Notably, **Ascl1**, which encodes achaete-scute family bHLH transcription factor 1, drives the differentiation of neural progenitor cells toward either GABAergic neurons or oligodendrocyte precursor cells depending on developmental timing and the phosphorylation status of Ascl1 itself by proline-directed serine/threonine kinases such as ERK.[2][36] Recent breakthrough experiments demonstrate that **Ascl1SA6**, a mutant form of Ascl1 with reduced phosphorylation sites, can reprogram lineage-traced astrocytes toward a neuronal fate, with forced expression driving expression of the neuronal marker NeuN in 9.23 ± 0.49% of EmGFP+ astrocytes per mm², significantly more than observed in EmGFP controls.[2][40] Critically, the inclusion of microRNA-124 (miR-124) target sites in the 3'UTR of the transgene effectively reduced off-target neuronal expression while preserving Ascl1SA6 expression in astrocytes, indicating that post-transcriptional regulation of neurogenic transcription factors is essential for cellular precision.[2][40] The fact that Ascl1SA6 preferentially drives astrocytic conversion toward GABAergic neuronal-like cell fates, while inclusion of miR-124 sites redirects cells toward more glutamatergic neuronal and oligodendrocyte-like cell identities, highlights the profound influence of post-transcriptional modulation on fate specification.[2][40]\n\n## Neurotrophic Signaling and Neural Plasticity\n\n### Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Pathways and TrkB Signaling\n\nThe input gene list includes genes involved in neurotrophic signaling cascades that regulate dendritic and axonal development, synapse formation, and activity-dependent plasticity. While **BDNF** itself is not explicitly included in the input list, multiple genes that regulate BDNF signaling are present. **RBFOX1**, an RNA binding fox-1 homologue encoding a splicing factor highly conserved among vertebrates and expressed in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, regulates both alternative splicing and transcriptional networks in human neuronal development.[21][19] Crucially, in human neural stem cells, RBFOX1 knockdown increased BDNF expression levels, while in mice, TrkB was identified as a target of RBFOX1 within the hippocampus.[19] Furthermore, PAC1-short activation (from alternative splicing of the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide type 1 receptor) can elevate BDNF levels and potentiate TRKB activity, enhancing BDNF/TRKB neuroprotective and plasticity-promoting effects, especially in the context of stress response and neuropsychiatric health.[19] Recent studies in zebrafish carrying an rbfox1 loss-of-function mutation demonstrate that rbfox1 LoF results in behavioral changes relevant to core domains altered in human psychiatric disorders (such as hyperactivity, impulsivity, reduced habituation, and heightened arousal) and suggest that adaptation occurs as the animal develops.[19] These findings indicate that **RBFOX1 regulates developmental stress-response pathways** through control of BDNF/TRKB signaling, and that the dysregulation of RBFOX1-dependent splicing could contribute to altered plasticity in the tumor microenvironment.\n\n### Neuregulin and ErbB4 Signaling in GABAergic Interneuron Development\n\n**NRG1** (neuregulin-1), **NRG3**, and **ERBB4** (ErbB4 receptor tyrosine kinase) form a critical signaling axis in the development and function of GABAergic interneurons.[20][22][23] NRG1-ErbB4 signaling toward parvalbumin-expressing interneurons represents a well-characterized pathway in which the ligand (NRG1) is produced by pyramidal neurons and acts on ErbB4 receptors expressed on GABAergic interneurons to regulate their migration, differentiation, and synaptic integration.[22][23] The NRG1-ErbB4 signaling system has been implicated in temporal lobe epilepsy and schizophrenia pathogenesis, with specific variants in NRG1 and ERBB4 associated with increased disease risk.[20][26] In the context of glioblastoma, recent findings demonstrate that neuregulin-1 regulates the conversion of M1/M2 microglia phenotype via ErbB4-dependent inhibition of the NF-κB pathway,[20] suggesting that tumor cells may exploit the NRG1-ErbB4 signaling axis to remodel the peritumoral immune microenvironment. Additionally, evidence of trans-synaptic signaling through NRG1-ErbB4 suggests that this pathway may be involved in activity-dependent remodeling of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses.[20]\n\n## Axonal Guidance and Neuronal Migration\n\n### Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) and Netrin Signaling\n\n**DCC** encodes the deleted in colorectal cancer receptor, which serves as the primary receptor for netrin-1, a secreted guidance cue that directs axonal pathfinding during neural development.[35] Remarkably, glioma cells produce netrin-1 and other chemotactic factors that guide migration of both tumor cells and surrounding neurons, recapitulating physiologic migration patterns of glial progenitor cells that enable fast and diffuse permeation of the brain parenchyma.[34] This phenomenon of tumor cells exploiting developmental guidance pathways to promote both their own dissemination and alterations in neighboring neuronal populations represents a striking example of how oncogenic transformation can reactivate and misuse normal developmental programs.[34] The input gene list includes several genes involved in the axonal guidance program, including **ROBO1** and **ROBO2**, which encode roundabout receptors that mediate repulsive signaling through interaction with slit ligands.[35] The coordinated expression of multiple guidance receptors and their ligands in the tumor microenvironment would be expected to create a complex landscape of attractive and repulsive cues that reshape perilesional neuronal connectivity and circuit organization.\n\n### Cell Adhesion Molecules and Neurite Outgrowth\n\n**CHL1** (cell adhesion molecule L1-like), **CNTN5** (contactin-5), **CNTNAP2** (contactin-associated protein-like 2), and **NTM** (neurotrimin) are all cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily that mediate neurite outgrowth, axonal fasciculation, and synaptic adhesion.[14][17][35] **CNTNAP2** is a member of the neurexin superfamily that plays an essential role in neural development and has significant association with neurodevelopmental disorders.[14] The interaction between pre- and postsynaptic adhesion molecules, such as neurexin-neuroligin pairs, provides specificity for synapse formation and determines the molecular identity of developing synapses.[15] Notably, the peritumoral cortex exhibits increased dendritic spine density and altered patterns of axonal innervation,[3] phenomena that suggest aberrant adhesion molecule signaling and circuit rewiring. The fact that multiple adhesion molecules from distinct protein families are represented in the input gene list suggests that the tumor microenvironment triggers broad perturbations in neurite-neurite and cell-cell interactions that extend beyond individual molecular pathways.\n\n## Transcriptional and Post-Transcriptional Gene Regulation\n\n### Intermediate Progenitor Cell Specification and Glioblastoma Plasticity\n\nThe transcription factor **INSM1** (insulinoma-associated 1) has recently emerged as a critical regulator of a neuronal progenitor state that drives glioblastoma tumorigenicity and plasticity.[5][48] In an isogenic human neural stem cell (NSC) model of glioblastoma generated by sequential addition of TERT promoter, TP53, and PDGFRA point mutations, tumor cell evolution triggers stress-related metabolic changes and transitions toward a neuronal progenitor network driven specifically by INSM1 expression.[5][48] INSM1 is highly expressed in human glioblastoma tumors and, during cortical development, in intermediate progenitor cells that give rise to neurons.[5][48] Critically, **INSM1 knockdown in triple mutant NSCs and primary glioblastoma cells disrupts oncogenic gene expression and function and inhibits the in vivo tumorigenicity**, highlighting the functional importance of an intermediate progenitor cell-like cell state in glioblastoma pathogenesis.[5][48] This discovery fundamentally reframes our understanding of glioblastoma: rather than being composed of fully dedifferentiated stem cells, these tumors appear to exploit specific developmental states—particularly the intermediate progenitor stage—to maximize their proliferative capacity while retaining sufficient plasticity to respond to environmental pressures.\n\n### RBFOX1 and CELF4: Splicing Factors Regulating Neuronal Identity\n\n**RBFOX1** and **CELF4** (CUGBP Elav-like family member 4) encode RNA-binding proteins that regulate alternative splicing of genes controlling neuronal development and function.[21][19] RBFOX1 has been identified as a critical regulator of neuronal development and function, with loss of function associated with increased vulnerability to psychiatric disease through HPA axis hyperactivation and altered BDNF/TRKB signaling.[19] CELF4 is similarly involved in the regulation of developmentally important neuronal genes and synaptic proteins. The fact that both RBFOX1 and CELF4 are included in the input list suggests that post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression programs may be a key mechanism by which glioblastoma cells maintain plasticity. Recent findings in schizophrenia have identified a novel miRNA-lncRNA pathway in which the disease-risk miRNA **miR-137** enhances expression of the disease-risk lncRNA GOMAFU in human neuron development, with this pathway functioning through effects on histone acetylation and transcription factor expression.[42] Notably, many of the miR-137-regulated transcription factors are themselves implicated in astrocytoma pathogenesis and cell fate determination.\n\n### Srrm4 and Neuronal-Specific Splicing Regulation\n\n**SRRM4** (serine and arginine rich matrix protein 4) is a neuronal-specific splicing regulator that controls the inclusion of neuronal-specific exons in hundreds of genes critical for neuronal development and function.[52] The overexpression of SRRM4 in non-neuronal cells can drive the acquisition of neuronal characteristics through widespread changes in alternative splicing, suggesting that this splicing factor acts as a master regulator of neuronal identity at the post-transcriptional level. In the context of glioblastoma plasticity, the dysregulation of SRRM4 or other neuronal splicing factors could contribute to the reactivation of neuronal developmental programs within tumor cells, thereby enhancing their adaptability to microenvironmental challenges.\n\n## Synaptotagmin and Vesicular Release Machinery\n\n### Calcium Sensors in Neurotransmitter Release\n\n**SYT1** and **SYT14** encode synaptotagmin isoforms that serve as calcium sensors for the rapid triggering of neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles.[15] SYT1 is the prototypical calcium sensor that couples calcium influx through VGCCs to the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, a process essential for fast synaptic transmission. SYT14 has more restricted neuronal expression and may be involved in slower secretion or in neuromodulatory substance release. The fact that both SYT1 and SYT14 are included in the input list, along with multiple calcium channel genes, suggests that the regulation of calcium-dependent secretion represents a coherent functional module within the list. Glioma cells release glutamate and other signaling molecules that provoke high-frequency or even epileptiform discharges in adjacent neurons,[25][47] a phenomenon that could be mediated by aberrant activation of calcium-dependent release machinery in either tumor cells or in perilesional neurons responding to tumor-derived factors.\n\n### RIMS Complex Assembly and Vesicular Priming\n\n**RIMS1** and **RIMS2** encode RIM family proteins that assemble the active zone scaffold complex and couple voltage-gated calcium channels to the synaptic vesicle release machinery.[15] These multivalent proteins interact with multiple partners including syntaxins, munc13 proteins, and calcium channels to create the molecular architecture that ensures rapid, efficient neurotransmitter release in response to action potentials. The involvement of RIMS family proteins in the input list, combined with calcium channel and synaptotagmin genes, suggests that the presynaptic release apparatus represents a well-defined functional module. Alterations in the expression or phosphorylation of RIMS proteins could contribute to either enhanced or impaired neurotransmitter release in perilesional neurons, thereby affecting the balance of excitatory and inhibitory input to local circuits.\n\n## Cytoskeletal Dynamics and Dendritic Spine Remodeling\n\n### Dihydropyrimidinase-Related Proteins and Microtubule Dynamics\n\nThe input list includes **DPYSL5** (dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 5), which encodes a protein that coordinates cytoskeleton dynamics in developing neuronal cells by regulating filopodia formation, axonal guidance, and neurite outgrowth through direct interaction with tubulin and actin.[29] The tubulin-DPYSL5 interaction leads to inhibition of microtubule polymerization and consequently negative regulation of dendritic growth in cultured neurons,[29] whereas related DPYSL proteins like DPYSL2 promote dendritic elongation. Notably, missense variants in DPYSL5 associated with neurodevelopmental disorders cause loss of the inhibitory regulation of dendritic growth, with proposed pathophysiological mechanisms involving decreased interaction ability between mutated DPYSL5 and the cytoskeleton-associated proteins MAP2 and TUBB3.[29] These findings suggest that fine-tuning of the cytoskeletal inhibitory pathways is essential for appropriate dendritic development. In the tumor microenvironment, perilesional neurons exhibit increased dendritic spine density with significant differences in apical dendrites and second-branch dendrites in TAS patients compared to non-TAS patients,[3] suggesting that tumor-derived factors specifically enhance dendritic elaboration and spine formation through pathways involving DPYSL and related cytoskeletal regulators.\n\n### Myo16 and Actin Dynamics\n\n**MYO16** encodes a myosin protein involved in actin dynamics and cellular morphology. The inclusion of multiple genes regulating actin polymerization and microtubule organization suggests that the tumor microenvironment triggers broad remodeling of the dendritic cytoskeleton through multiple convergent pathways. Recent discoveries demonstrate that transient, localized activation of Rac1, a small GTPase regulating actin dynamics, is sufficient to induce and maintain structural long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons independently of CaMKII,[31] with Rac1 identified as a self-sustaining signaling module in synaptic plasticity that provides mechanistic insight into the biochemical encoding of long-lasting synaptic changes. This finding suggests that tumor-derived signals enhancing Rac1 activation could drive persistent dendritic spine growth and synaptic potentiation through mechanisms distinct from classical activity-dependent plasticity.\n\n## Phosphorylation-Based Signaling and Kinase Regulation\n\n### CaMKII and Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Phosphorylation\n\n**CAMK2B** encodes the beta isoform of calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a serine/threonine kinase that serves as a central integrator of calcium signals and a crucial mediator of experience-dependent synaptic plasticity.[13] CaMKII autophosphorylation creates a molecular switch that allows transient calcium signals to be converted into persistent changes in synaptic strength, and this bistable switching mechanism is thought to underlie the stability of long-term memory.[13] The phosphorylation of postsynaptic density proteins like PSD-95 and GKAP by CaMKII regulates the surface expression and synaptic localization of AMPA and NMDA receptors.[15] However, recent discoveries using photoactivatable Rac1 demonstrate that transient, localized Rac1 activation can induce persistent spine growth independently of CaMKII, suggesting that alternative molecular switches may operate in parallel.[31] In the tumor context, the dysregulation of CaMKII phosphorylation cascades through altered calcium influx patterns could contribute to the aberrant synaptic plasticity observed in perilesional neurons.\n\n### PP2A Subunit Diversity and AIS-Specific Protein Dephosphorylation\n\n**PPP2R2C** encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) that localizes specifically to the axon initial segment (AIS) and functionally interacts with the Kv1.2 channel to regulate its expression and neuronal activity during development.[10] The discovery of distinct PP2A subunits with different subcellular localizations reveals a previously unrecognized specificity in how protein phosphorylation is reversed at functionally distinct neuronal compartments. The findings that Ppp2r2c-OE leads to a remarkable potentiation of neuronal activity while both Ppp2r2a and Ppp2r2c are involved in regulating baseline neuronal firing suggest that precise PP2A targeting is essential for normal neuronal activity regulation.[10] The dysfunction of PP2A-B55 subunits at the AIS could contribute to the altered action potential generation and intrinsic excitability observed in perilesional neurons.\n\n### AKAP11 and Compartmentalized PKA Signaling\n\n**AKAP11** (A-kinase anchoring protein 11) encodes a scaffold protein that couples PKA kinase networks to synaptic transmission and mediates previously uncharacterized autophagic functions in neurons through interaction with the ER-resident autophagy-related proteins VAPA/B.[13] Loss of AKAP11 results in compartment-specific changes of PKA activity in neurons, with the study demonstrating the role of AKAP11 in coupling PKA kinase network regulation to synaptic transmission.[13] The downregulated expression of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, CAMKIIA, in AKAP11-deficient neurons indicates reduced neuronal calcium signaling, which plays a pivotal role in synaptic plasticity and memory formation.[13] These findings suggest that the scaffolding functions of AKAP11 create discrete signaling microdomains where PKA can selectively phosphorylate substrates important for synaptic transmission. The dysregulation of AKAP11 signaling in the tumor microenvironment could disrupt these compartmentalized signaling events and contribute to altered plasticity.\n\n## Ion Channel Auxiliary Proteins and Modulation\n\n### Potassium Channel Modulatory Proteins\n\nThe input gene list includes genes encoding auxiliary and regulatory proteins for ion channels, including **KCNMA1** (potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily M alpha 1), which encodes the alpha-1 subunit of a large-conductance, voltage-gated potassium channel (BK channel) that is activated by both voltage and calcium.[61] BK channels play a critical role in action potential repolarization and determine the firing frequency of neurons, and **KCNMB2** encodes an auxiliary beta subunit that modulates BK channel properties. The inclusion of multiple potassium channel genes in the input list, spanning voltage-gated (KCNQ, KCNC, KCNB), inwardly-rectifying (KCNJ), and calcium-activated (KCNMA) families, suggests that the comprehensive regulation of neuronal repolarization and excitability represents a key functional module dysregulated in the tumor microenvironment.\n\n### Inactivation Gating and Recovery Mechanisms\n\n**DPP10** (dipeptidyl-peptidase 10) is an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated potassium channels belonging to the Kv4 family that modulates channel kinetics and surface expression, with mutations associated with epilepsy and sudden unexpected nocturnal death in epilepsy (SUDEP).[15] The inclusion of DPP10 suggests that the regulation of rapid-inactivating potassium channels, which set the subthreshold excitability and firing frequency of neurons, represents an important aspect of the dysregulation observed in tumor-associated seizures.\n\n## Neuropeptide and Neuromodulator Signaling\n\n### Neuropeptide Y and GABAergic Identity\n\nThe input list includes **NPY** (neuropeptide Y) signaling-related genes, though NPY itself is not explicitly listed. However, the downstream effects of NPY signaling on GABAergic neuron biology are relevant to understanding the broader neuromodulatory landscape. Recent findings demonstrate that **Ascl1 SA6** robustly induces NPY expression in astrocytes undergoing conversion toward GABAergic neuronal fates, whereas **Ascl1 SA6 -124T** preferentially activates genes linked to glutamatergic identity including Grik2, Kcnd2, Nlgn1, Nrxn1, Ncam2, Npas3, Syn2, Gria2, and Map2.[2][40] This striking differentiation between two closely related genetic constructs highlights how subtle changes in transgene composition can redirect the fate specification of reprogramming cells, with profound implications for understanding tumor cell plasticity. The fact that different transcriptional programs can be activated in response to subtle molecular cues suggests that the tumor microenvironment presents a constantly shifting landscape of signals that guide cell fate decisions.\n\n### PRLR and Growth Factor Signaling\n\n**PRLR** (prolactin receptor) is included in the input list and represents neuroendocrine signaling through growth hormone family cytokines. Prolactin signaling in the central nervous system regulates synaptic transmission, neurogenesis, and neuroprotection through STAT3 and other signaling pathways. The inclusion of PRLR suggests that neuroendocrine factors may modulate neuronal properties in the tumor microenvironment.\n\n## Astrocytic Activation and Inflammatory Responses\n\n### GFAP Expression and Astrocytic Phenotype Transitions\n\nWhile **GFAP** (glial fibrillary acidic protein) is not explicitly included in the input list, the mechanisms of astrocyte activation and phenotypic switching are directly relevant to understanding how the tumor microenvironment alters the behavior of resident glial cells. Recent high-throughput RNA sequencing of astrocytes isolated at acute, subacute, and chronic time points following traumatic brain injury reveals sustained astrocyte activation with transcriptional signatures evolving from an early pro-inflammatory profile to a mixed phenotype featuring both neurodegenerative and regenerative elements.[24][55] These findings provide a template for understanding how astrocytic phenotype evolves in response to pathological insults, and the same principles likely apply to astrocytes resident in the glioma microenvironment. Notably, a subset of astrocytes in chronic phases following injury displayed increased expression of genes associated with neural stem cell maintenance and neurogenesis, including markers like SOX2, EGFR, and CXCR4,[24][55] suggesting that injury-activated astrocytes retain multipotential capacity for neural differentiation.\n\n### Reactive Astrogliosis and Tau-Related Neuroinflammation\n\nRecent work examining the relationship between APOE ε4 carriership, tau burden, and astrocyte reactivity measured by cerebrospinal fluid YKL-40 (Chitinase-3-like protein 1) demonstrates that astrocyte reactivity is positively associated with tau pathology, with APOE ε4 carriership potentiating this relationship.[46] These findings suggest that genetic risk factors modulate the intensity and specificity of astrocytic inflammatory responses, and similar gene-by-environment interactions may operate in glioblastoma progression. The fact that astrocytes represent the most abundant glial cells in the central nervous system and are integral to maintaining neuronal homeostasis, regulating blood-brain barrier integrity, and modulating synaptic function,[55] suggests that tumor-driven alterations in astrocytic phenotype would have profound effects on perilesional neuronal function and survival.\n\n## Vesicular Trafficking and Synaptic Organization\n\n### RabGTPases and Vesicle Dynamics\n\n**RAB3C** (rab3c member of the RAS oncogene family) encodes a small GTPase involved in synaptic vesicle priming and docking at the active zone, with mutations affecting synaptic transmission and learning. The **RIMS** and **ERC2** genes encode active zone scaffold proteins that organize the machinery for calcium-triggered vesicle fusion and couple vesicular release to multiple regulatory pathways. These genes collectively define a functional module controlling the spatial organization and triggering of neurotransmitter release.\n\n## Metabolic Reprogramming and Tumor Cell Plasticity\n\n### Oxidative Phosphorylation and Glioma Resistance\n\nRecent discoveries using translatome profiling combined with transcriptomic analyses identify **oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis dysregulation** as key resistance mechanisms in glioblastoma, with particular relevance to understanding why anti-CSF-1R therapies targeting tumor-associated macrophages and microglia fail clinically.[37] The fact that triple combination therapy targeting oxidative phosphorylation/glycolysis using piperlongumine or vorinostat significantly improves survival in glioma-bearing mice when combined with standard therapy suggests that metabolic reprogramming is not merely a consequence of transformation but rather a critical enabler of tumor cell plasticity and therapeutic resistance.[37] The input gene list includes genes involved in metabolic regulation including kinases and phosphatases that could modulate the metabolic state of both tumor cells and surrounding neurons.\n\n### Hippo Pathway and YAP/TAZ Signaling\n\nWhile explicit Hippo pathway components are not uniformly present in the input list, genes like **VAV3** (VAV guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3) are involved in Rho family GTPase signaling that intersects with Hippo pathway output. The Hippo pathway acts as a master regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation through effects on YAP/TAZ phosphorylation and nuclear localization, with implications for both tumor cell plasticity and the maintenance of progenitor cell states.\n\n## Epigenetic Regulation and Chromatin Remodeling\n\n### Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 and H3K27 Methylation\n\nWhile **EZH2** (enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit) is not explicitly included in the input list, the broader theme of chromatin remodeling and epigenetic control of gene expression is evident in the inclusion of splicing factors and transcriptional regulators. The fact that low-grade astrocytoma mutations in IDH1, TP53, and ATRX cooperate to block differentiation of human neural stem cells via repression of SOX2,[5][48] and that glioblastoma exhibits characteristic epigenetic alterations including H3K27M mutations and IDH1-mediated alterations in methylation patterns,[1][32] indicates that chromatin state represents a fundamental axis of glioma biology. The input gene list includes several transcriptional regulators and chromatin-associated proteins that could modulate accessibility to genes controlling differentiation versus proliferation.\n\n## Synaptic Adhesion and Circuit Assembly\n\n### Neurexin-Neuroligin Signaling Specificity\n\nThe input list includes genes encoding components of the neurexin-neuroligin adhesion system that provides molecular specificity for synapse formation. **NRXN1** (neurexin-1) and related neurexins are presynaptic adhesion molecules that interact with postsynaptic neuroligins to determine the identity and function of developing synapses. The alternative splicing patterns of neurexins and neuroligins create combinatorial complexity that allows for distinct molecular identities of ostensibly similar synapses, a phenomenon with profound implications for how circuit connectivity is specified during development and can be remodeled in response to environmental challenges or pathological insults.\n\n### Dendritic Spine Density and Synaptic Multiplicity\n\nPerilesional neurons in glioma patients with tumor-associated seizures display significantly increased dendritic spine density compared to non-TAS patients, with particularly prominent changes in apical and second-branch dendrites.[3] This increase in synaptic multiplicity occurs alongside transcriptional changes consistent with enhanced synaptic plasticity, suggesting that tumor-derived factors reactivate developmental plasticity programs that normally drive the dramatic increases in synaptic density observed during critical periods of brain development. The multiple adhesion molecules, scaffolding proteins, and plasticity-related genes in the input list provide mechanistic underpinnings for how these structural changes could be achieved.\n\n## Channel-Associated Proteins and Targeting\n\n### Ankyrin-G and AIS Organization\n\n**ANK3** (ankyrin G) encodes a critical structural protein that organizes the axon initial segment and serves as a central hub for clustering voltage-gated sodium channels, voltage-gated potassium channels, and cell adhesion molecules.[10] The ankyrin-G scaffold creates the molecular organization essential for rapid action potential initiation and has been identified in genome-wide association studies as a risk locus for multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. Recent discoveries demonstrate that ankyrin-G interacts with multiple proteins included in the input list, including **Kv1.2** and members of the L1 CAM family, suggesting that the AIS represents a highly organized functional module whose disruption could contribute to both neuronal circuit dysfunction and tumor-associated seizures.\n\n### GKAP/DLGAP and PSD Hierarchy\n\nThe inclusion of multiple GKAP/DLGAP family members (implicit in DLG genes) highlights how the stoichiometry of postsynaptic density components determines overall scaffold architecture and function. The discovery that GKAP degradation, rather than PSD-95 degradation, is the primary driver of PSD shrinkage indicates a hierarchical organization in which specific scaffold components act as structural keystones.[41][51] This hierarchical principle may extend to other complexes, such that the dysregulation of one key component could trigger cascading reorganization of the entire complex.\n\n## Microglia and Immune System Interactions\n\n### CSF1R Signaling and Macrophage/Microglia Polarization\n\nWhile explicit immune cell markers are not the primary focus of the input gene list, the **NRG1-ERBB4** axis represents an important bridge between neuronal signaling and immune cell function, with neuregulin-1 regulating the conversion of M1/M2 microglia phenotype via ErbB4-dependent inhibition of the NF-κB pathway.[20] This finding suggests that neuronal-derived signals, particularly those altered in the glioma microenvironment, directly shape the polarization state of resident immune cells. The recent identification of pericytes as orchestrating a tumor-restraining microenvironment through strategic positioning and paracrine signaling provides additional context for understanding how the cellular interactions within the glioma microenvironment determine its growth-promoting or growth-restricting properties.[34]\n\n## Pericyte Function and Vascular Microenvironment\n\n### Pericyte-Derived Signaling and Tumor Suppression\n\nRemarkably, due to high degrees of glioma cell intrinsic plasticity, gliomas can react to and escape from environmental pressures such as lack of oxygen or therapeutically induced stress.[34] Recent evidence demonstrates that pericytes mitigate glioma development by orchestrating a tumor-suppressive microenvironment through strategic positioning adjacent to blood vessels with easy access to the malignant parenchyma.[34] The fact that pericyte-depleted tumors show increased immune-suppressive myeloid cell infiltration and permissive perivascular niches suggests that pericyte preservation in future glioblastoma therapies may be therapeutically important.[34] While pericyte-derived genes are not explicitly included in the input list, the broader principle that the cellular composition of the microenvironment fundamentally determines tumor behavior is directly relevant to understanding how the neuronal populations represented by the input gene list interact with stromal and immune components.\n\n---\n\n# Integration: Astrocytoma as a Disease of Developmental Plasticity and Cellular Context\n\nThe comprehensive analysis of these 200+ genes in the context of astrocytoma reveals a striking picture: rather than representing a disorganized collection of genes dysregulated at random, the input gene list captures major functional modules controlling developmental cell fate determination, synaptic plasticity, neuronal excitability, and the transcriptional programs governing the transition between differentiation states. **The central organizing principle appears to be that glioblastoma exploits developmental programs normally silenced in mature tissues to maintain a plastic cellular state responsive to environmental cues while evading the differentiation signals that would normally restrict glioma cells to a single cell fate.**\n\nThe identification of INSM1 as a critical driver of glioma tumorigenicity through its control of an intermediate progenitor cell-like state represents a conceptual breakthrough: these are not fully dedifferentiated stem cells, but rather cells frozen at a specific developmental stage that confers both proliferative advantage and plasticity. The availability of multiple transcriptional programs in this state—including GABAergic and glutamatergic neuronal differentiation pathways—allows glioma cells to respond to local signals that recruit specific transcriptional modules in response to local selective pressures. This state is furthermore supported and sustained by altered metabolic programs, including enhanced oxidative phosphorylation and dysregulated glycolysis, that fuel both proliferation and the continuous remodeling of cellular structures required for migration and invasion.\n\nThe perilesional neuronal alterations that culminate in seizure generation represent a second critical manifestation of glioma pathophysiology captured by the input gene list. Glioma cells release glutamate and other signaling molecules that create a pathological microenvironment characterized by excitotoxicity, altered monoaminergic tone, and aberrant neuromodulation. These signals act upon perilesional neurons through multiple mechanisms: direct excitotoxicity through excessive glutamate-mediated calcium influx, altered phosphorylation states of ion channels and scaffolding proteins that shift the balance toward increased excitability, and reactivation of developmental plasticity programs that drive dendritic elaboration and spine formation while simultaneously predisposing networks to aberrant synchronous discharge.

Multiple genes in the input list including kinases and phosphatases could modulate metabolic state of both tumor cells and perilesional neurons.\",\n      \"atomic_biological_processes\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production dysregulation\",\n          \"citations\": [\n            {\n              \"source_id\": \"37\",\n              \"notes\": \"Oxidative phosphorylation dysregulation identified as key resistance mechanism in glioblastoma\"\n            }\n          ],\n          \"genes\": []\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Glycolytic reprogramming and Warburg effect\",\n          \"citations\": [\n            {\n              \"source_id\": \"37\",\n              \"notes\": \"Glycolysis dysregulation contributes to glioma resistance mechanisms\"\n            }\n          ],\n          \"genes\": []\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Metabolic plasticity enabling therapeutic resistance\",\n          \"citations\": [\n            {\n              \"source_id\": \"37\",\n              \"notes\": \"Targeting metabolic dysregulation with HDAC inhibitors or polyphenols improves therapeutic response\"\n            }\n          ],\n          \"genes\": []\n        }\n      ],\n      \"atomic_cellular_components\": [],\n      \"predicted_cellular_impact\": [\n        \"Enhanced metabolic flexibility enabling tumor cell adaptation to changing microenvironmental conditions\",\n        \"Resistance to metabolic stress including hypoxia and nutrient depletion\",\n        \"Altered energy substrate preference affecting both tumor cell and immune cell function\",\n        \"Dysregulated mitochondrial function contributing to altered calcium handling and excitability\"\n      ],\n      \"evidence_summary\": \"Glioblastoma cells exhibit profound alterations in metabolic programming, including increased oxidative phosphorylation and dysregulated glycolysis that together support both rapid proliferation and cellular plasticity.

The identification of distinct gene programs—including calcium signaling, glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission, synaptic scaffolding, transcriptional control, and metabolic reprogramming—suggests that astrocytoma represents not a disorganized derangement of cellular function but rather a systematic reactivation and misuse of developmentally programmed cell fate decisions and plasticity mechanisms. **The central pathogenic mechanism appears to be that glioblastoma cells exploit the intermediate progenitor cell state, normally transiently active during cortical development, to maintain a plastic cellular state responsive to environmental cues while evading the differentiation signals that would restrict them to a single cell fate.** This plasticity is further enabled and sustained by metabolic reprogramming that supports both rapid proliferation and continuous remodeling of cellular structures required for migration and invasion.\n\nThe perilesional neuronal dysfunction and seizure generation represent the consequence of tumor-derived alterations in the microenvironment, including elevated glutamate concentration, altered monoaminergic tone, and production of chemotactic guidance factors. These signals act upon the substantial collection of synaptic, ion channel, and developmental genes represented in the input list to collectively shift perilesional neurons toward a state of heightened excitability and plasticity resembling critical developmental periods. The numerous ion channel genes, calcium signaling components, and synaptic plasticity regulators thereby enable understanding of how the tumor microenvironment creates a permissive substrate for seizure generation and aberrant circuit rewiring. Future therapeutic approaches targeting astrocytoma must therefore address not only the tumor cells themselves but also the fundamental developmental programs and metabolic dependencies that sustain their plasticity, while simultaneously considering interventions that restore normal homeostatic constraints on perilesional neuronal excitability through modulation of the dysregulated synaptic and ion channel programs documented here.",

Recent discoveries reveal that GKAP, rather than PSD-95, acts as the primary structural determinant of PSD size, indicating a hierarchical architecture where specific components act as keystones. The involvement of multiple auxiliary proteins including LRRC7 and EDIL3 suggests additional layers of complexity in PSD organization.",

Remarkably, acute degradation experiments reveal that GKAP acts as the primary structural determinant of PSD size, with GKAP degradation causing significant shrinkage and PSD-95 efflux, whereas acute PSD-95 degradation paradoxically does not reduce PSD size and is associated with influx of other PSD molecules into the same postsynaptic sites. This hierarchical organization indicates that dysregulation of specific scaffolding components could selectively alter receptor composition without triggering wholesale synapse loss, a property highly relevant to understanding how tumor-driven perturbations could remodel synaptic properties.",

MYT1L serves as a master regulator that represses glial genes while activating neuronal genes, with overexpression capable of driving neuronal differentiation of non-neuronal cell types. INSM1 has recently been identified as a critical driver of glioblastoma tumorigenicity through its control of an intermediate progenitor cell-like state, with INSM1 knockdown in glioblastoma cells disrupting oncogenic gene expression and reducing in vivo tumorigenicity. RBFOX1 regulates both alternative splicing and transcriptional networks in neuronal development, with loss of function associated with psychiatric disease vulnerability through altered BDNF/TRKB signaling. SRRM4 and other neuronal-specific splicing factors control the inclusion of neuronal exons in hundreds of genes, effectively acting as master regulators of neuronal identity at the post-transcriptional level. In astrocytoma, the reactivation of these developmental programs through ectopic expression or dysregulation of their repressors would contribute to the remarkable cellular plasticity observed in these tumors.",

Remarkably, glioma cells produce netrin-1 and other chemotactic factors that guide migration of both tumor cells and surrounding neurons, recapitulating physiologic migration patterns of glial progenitor cells that enable rapid dissemination through brain parenchyma. This phenomenon of tumor cells exploiting developmental guidance pathways represents a striking example of how oncogenic transformation reactivates and misuses normal developmental programs.

Genetic variants in NRG1 and ERBB4 are associated with schizophrenia and temporal lobe epilepsy, suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway predisposes to both neurodevelopmental and seizure disorders. In the context of glioblastoma, NRG1-ErbB4 signaling extends beyond the neuronal compartment to regulate microglial phenotype, with neuregulin-1 driving the conversion of M1/M2 microglia phenotypes through ErbB4-dependent inhibition of the NF-κB pathway. This dual role of NRG1-ErbB4 signaling in both neuronal and immune cell functions suggests that dysregulation of this pathway in the tumor microenvironment could contribute to both altered perilesional neuronal circuitry and an altered immune microenvironment that favors tumor progression.",

INSM1 is highly expressed in human glioblastoma tumors and during normal development in intermediate progenitor cells that serve as the primary source of neurons in the developing cortex. The functional importance of the INSM1-driven progenitor state is underscored by the finding that INSM1 knockdown in both triple mutant NSCs and primary glioblastoma cells significantly disrupts oncogenic gene expression programs and dramatically reduces in vivo tumorigenicity.

Following central nervous system injury, astrocytes undergo reactive transformation characterized by morphological, molecular, and functional changes. Recent high-throughput RNA sequencing reveals that astrocyte transcriptional signatures evolve across injury phases, with acute profiles dominated by pro-inflammatory responses that transition to mixed phenotypes featuring both neurodegenerative and regenerative elements by chronic timepoints. Critically, a subset of astrocytes maintains neurogenic potential and continues to express neural stem cell markers even at one year post-injury, suggesting ongoing neuroplasticity and regenerative capacity. In astrocytoma, resident astrocytes are exposed to tumor-derived factors that drive their transformation into activated states characterized by altered production of neurotrophic factors and inflammatory mediators, thereby creating a microenvironment that simultaneously promotes tumor growth while affecting perilesional neuronal function and survival.",

Recent translatome profiling identifies oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis dysregulation as key resistance mechanisms in glioma, particularly relevant to understanding why anti-CSF-1R therapies targeting tumor-associated macrophages and microglia fail clinically. The fact that targeting oxidative phosphorylation/glycolysis with piperlongumine or vorinostat significantly improves survival when combined with standard therapy suggests metabolic reprogramming is not merely a consequence of transformation but rather a critical enabler of tumor plasticity and therapeutic resistance. Multiple genes in the input list including kinases and phosphatases could modulate metabolic state of both tumor cells and perilesional neurons.",
