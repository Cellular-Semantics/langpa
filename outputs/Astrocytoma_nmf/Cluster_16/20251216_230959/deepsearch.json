GABA receptor subunits (GABRG3, GABRA1, GABRB2, GABRG2, GABRA4, GABRA5, GABRB3) appear consistently, SLC17A7 handles glutamate packaging, and SNAP25 facilitates SNARE-mediated vesicle fusion.\n\nSYN2 functions as a synapsin for synaptic plasticity, NRXN3 provides neuronal adhesion, and contactins (CNTN4, CNTN5) support cell-cell interactions. Neurotrophic factors BDNF and GDNF promote neuronal survival and growth. RNA-binding proteins RBFOX1 and RBFOX3 regulate gene expression, while SNCA contributes to synaptic function and MBP supports myelination.

Through systematic integration of current scientific literature, we identified fifteen distinct gene programs that collectively coordinate synaptic transmission, ion homeostasis, cell adhesion, metabolic function, and glial-neuronal communication. The analysis reveals that the most robust gene programs involve glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission systems, synaptic organization, and calcium signaling—processes that undergo significant dysregulation when neurons encounter tumor-derived astrocytes. Notably, multiple programs exhibit high significance scores due to the presence of complete pathway components within the input gene list, suggesting coordinated alterations of these systems in astrocytoma-affected brain tissue. Our findings highlight the neuron-specific transcriptional signatures that likely characterize neurons within tumor microenvironments, where aberrant synaptic plasticity, hyperexcitability, and loss of normal glial support drive neurological complications including seizures and cognitive decline.\n\n---\n\n## Biological and Pathophysiological Context\n\n### The Astrocytoma Microenvironment and Neuronal Dysfunction\n\nAstrocytomas represent the most common primary central nervous system malignancies, arising from neoplastic transformation of astrocytes[22]. These tumors create highly abnormal tissue microenvironments in which peritumoral neurons experience profound alterations to their electrophysiological and morphological properties[22]. Recent single-cell transcriptomic studies have revealed that neurons adjacent to gliomas exhibit distinct transcriptional alterations implicating dysregulation of neuronal homeostasis, synaptic transmission, and synaptic plasticity[22]. This aberrant neuronal state predisposes to tumor-associated seizures, a devastating complication affecting up to 80% of cortical glioma patients[22]. The peritumoral cortex (PTC) serves as a critical interface between normal neural tissue and advancing tumor, where neurons form direct electrochemical synapses with surrounding glioma cells, establishing bidirectional communication pathways that amplify both neuronal hyperexcitability and tumor proliferation[22].\n\n### Gene Expression Changes in Response to Tumor-Derived Factors\n\nThe molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal dysfunction in astrocytoma involve multiple convergent pathways. Glioma cells elevate local glutamate concentration through both synaptic and non-synaptic mechanisms, including dysregulation of the xCT transporter system and impairment of local glutamate reuptake[22]. These alterations directly compromise intracellular chloride homeostasis through disruption of chloride-cation cotransporters, fundamentally altering the valence of GABAergic signaling and converting inhibitory inputs into paradoxically excitatory signals[6][3]. Additionally, astrocytomas produce synaptogenic factors that dysregulate the synaptic proteome, remodel dendritic spines, and alter the balance between synaptic plasticity and neuronal stability[22][19].\n\n---\n\n## Program 1: Glutamatergic Synaptic Transmission and Ionotropic Receptor Signaling\n\n### Description\n\nGlutamatergic neurotransmission represents the primary excitatory signaling system in the central nervous system and comprises a coordinated program involving presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporters, synaptic release machinery, postsynaptic glutamate receptors, and calcium-dependent signaling cascades. Within the input gene list, this program encompasses NMDA receptor subunits (GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B), metabotropic glutamate receptors (GRM1, GRM5, GRM7), the vesicular glutamate transporter (SLC17A7), and associated calcium handling proteins. The NMDA receptor family serves as a calcium-permeable ligand-gated ion channel, enabling the translation of glutamate binding and membrane depolarization into intracellular calcium signaling events critical for synaptic plasticity[12][11]. GRIN1 encodes the obligatory NR1 subunit present in all functional NMDA receptors, while GRIN2A and GRIN2B encode alternative NR2 subunits that confer distinct pharmacological and kinetic properties[12]. Metabotropic glutamate receptors couple glutamate binding to G-protein signaling cascades that modulate intracellular calcium release and second messenger accumulation[36][39].\n\n### Altered Expression in Tauopathy and Early Neurodegeneration\n\nEvidence from animal models of Alzheimer disease tauopathy reveals that dysregulation of synaptic plasticity-related genes, specifically including GRIN1, GRIN2B, and associated markers of synaptic strength, correlates with cognitive decline and synapse loss in early disease stages[2]. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis in hippocampal neurons from tau-transgenic rats revealed selective downregulation of genes associated with glutamatergic synaptic transmission in multiple neuronal populations, particularly in dentate gyrus and CA regions[2]. This observation parallels the synaptic failure observed in the early stages of astrocytoma-associated neurodegeneration, where aberrant glutamate signaling drives hyperexcitability and subsequent neuronal exhaustion[22].\n\n### Astrocytoma-Specific Alterations\n\nIn peritumoral cortices from glioma patients with tumor-associated seizures (TAS), comparative transcriptomic analysis identified significant upregulation of genes encoding ionotropic glutamate receptors, including enhanced expression signatures characteristic of NMDA and AMPA receptor pathways[22]. This upregulation occurs in the context of elevated extracellular glutamate, creating a pathological amplification loop wherein tumor-derived glutamate drives excessive calcium influx through NMDA receptors, triggering cascades of excitotoxic signaling. The peritumoral neurons simultaneously exhibit altered intrinsic excitability and enhanced responsiveness to glutamate, indicating that tumor factors have rewired the fundamental gain of glutamatergic signaling within this tissue[22].\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impacts\n\n- Enhanced calcium influx through NMDA receptors in response to elevated extracellular glutamate\n- Dysregulated synaptic plasticity with pathological enhancement of long-term potentiation\n- Excitotoxic calcium accumulation driving mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death\n- Altered temporal dynamics of synaptic transmission due to changes in GRIN2 subunit composition\n\n### Supporting Genes\n\nGRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRM1, GRM5, GRM7, SLC17A7\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nDysregulation of glutamatergic signaling represents a core molecular feature of both normal neurodegenerative disease and astrocytoma-associated neuronal dysfunction[2][22]. The complete NMDA receptor assembly pathway is represented in the input gene list, including both obligatory (GRIN1) and variable (GRIN2A, GRIN2B) subunits. Expression profiling studies demonstrate context-dependent alterations in GRIN subunit composition, which fundamentally alter the calcium permeability and temporal dynamics of synaptic transmission. In astrocytoma, this program acquires particular pathological significance through the elevation of extracellular glutamate by tumor cells, converting normally beneficial activity-dependent synaptic strengthening into pathological excitotoxicity.\n\n### Significance Score\n\n0.92\n\n### Citations\n\n[2][11][12][22][36][39]\n\n---\n\n## Program 2: GABAergic Inhibitory Synaptic Transmission and Chloride Homeostasis\n\n### Description\n\nGABAergic neurotransmission constitutes the primary inhibitory signaling system in mammalian nervous systems and operates through GABA-gated chloride channels composed of distinct receptor subunits encoded by GABRA, GABRB, and GABRG gene families[3][6]. The input gene list includes multiple GABAR subunits (GABRA1, GABRA2, GABRA4, GABRA5, GABRB2, GABRB3, GABRG2, GABRG3) as well as critical chloride transporters that establish and maintain the chloride gradient necessary for hyperpolarizing GABAergic inhibition: the potassium-chloride cotransporter KCC2 (SLC12A5) and the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter NKCC1 (SLC12A2)[3][6][18]. The functional valence of GABA—whether it produces inhibition or paradoxical excitation—depends entirely upon intracellular chloride concentration ([Cl−]i), which is actively regulated by these transporters. Elevated [Cl−]i, as occurs when KCC2 function is reduced, inverts the electrochemical gradient, causing GABA-gated chloride channels to instead mediate cation efflux and membrane depolarization[6][3].\n\n### Critical Period Opening and Developmental GABAergic Maturation\n\nDuring normal neural development, GABAergic signaling undergoes a fundamental switch from excitatory (depolarizing) to inhibitory (hyperpolarizing) as the brain matures[3]. This transition depends upon age-appropriate downregulation of NKCC1 (sodium-chloride importer) and upregulation of KCC2 (chloride exporter), processes that establish low intracellular chloride concentrations characteristic of mature neurons[3]. Pharmacological studies in Drosophila and mammalian systems demonstrate that temporal manipulation of GABAergic signaling through altered GABA receptor function or transporter expression directly regulates the timing of critical periods for circuit refinement[3]. The initial expression of GAD1 (glutamate decarboxylase), the GABA synthetic enzyme, immediately precedes the opening of developmental critical periods, establishing a causal link between GABA maturation and circuit plasticity windows[3].\n\n### Aberrant GABAergic Signaling in Behavioral Learning and Drug Responses\n\nRecent evidence reveals that experience-dependent learning induces dynamic, circuit-specific changes in intracellular anion homeostasis through functional downregulation of KCC2 via protein dephosphorylation[6]. During reward learning in rats, VTA GABA neurons exhibit learning-dependent KCC2 downregulation, causing a shift toward excitatory GABA receptor signaling specifically during the critical acquisition phase[6]. This plasticity enhances synchronization of GABAergic networks and amplifies phasic dopamine neuron firing, enabling proper formation of cue-reward associations[6]. Importantly, artificially enhancing KCC2 function during learning blocks cue-reward association formation, demonstrating that this chloride homeostasis remodeling is functionally necessary for adaptive learning[6]. Furthermore, pathological experiences such as stress and addictive drug exposure induce similar shifts toward excitatory GABAergic signaling, suggesting that the KCC2-dependent remodeling of GABAergic valence represents a common mechanism through which distinct life experiences reshape neural circuits[6].\n\n### Astrocytoma and Peritumoral GABAergic Dysfunction\n\nIn peritumoral cortex adjacent to gliomas, the elevation of extracellular glutamate by tumor cells creates a vicious cycle of aberrant chloride handling. Excessive glutamate receptor activation drives calcium influx, activating calcium-dependent processes that facilitate KCC2 dephosphorylation and functional downregulation[6][3]. This renders peritumoral neurons dependent upon the excitatory component of GABAergic signaling, transforming what should be a calming, inhibitory input into a drive for further depolarization and spike generation[22]. Additionally, astrocytomas suppress the expression of genes involved in chloride extrusion, effectively trapping intracellular chloride at elevated levels. This pathological state converts the inhibitory interneurons surrounding the tumor into sources of excitation rather than inhibition, fundamentally destabilizing local circuit activity and driving seizure emergence[22].\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impacts\n\n- Inversion of GABAergic signaling valence from inhibitory to excitatory due to elevated intracellular chloride\n- Loss of tonic inhibition from parvalbumin-positive basket cells, destabilizing circuit dynamics\n- Enhanced neuronal excitability through paradoxical depolarizing GABA responses\n- Failure of adaptive plasticity mechanisms dependent on transient KCC2 downregulation\n- Reduced seizure threshold through loss of normal inhibitory tone\n\n### Supporting Genes\n\nGABRA1, GABRA2, GABRA4, GABRA5, GABRB2, GABRB3, GABRG2, GABRG3, SLC12A5, SLC12A2\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nThe GABAergic system represents a fundamental control node for circuit excitability and plasticity, with clinical evidence linking mutations in GABAR or chloride transporter genes to developmental disorders, epilepsy, and autism spectrum conditions[3][6]. The input gene list contains comprehensive representation of GABA receptor subunit diversity and both major chloride transporters, enabling reconstruction of the complete chloride homeostasis program. Studies in multiple model systems and disease contexts demonstrate that disruption of KCC2-dependent chloride regulation produces rapid, dramatic shifts in circuit function. In the astrocytoma context, glutamate-driven alterations to chloride homeostasis represent a particularly powerful mechanism through which tumor cells can remotely manipulate the functional properties of surrounding neural circuits.\n\n### Significance Score\n\n0.95\n\n### Citations\n\n[3][6][18][22]\n\n---\n\n## Program 3: Calcium-Dependent Synaptic Signaling and Plasticity\n\n### Description\n\nCalcium functions as the primary second messenger linking neuronal activity to long-lasting changes in synaptic strength through activation of calcium-dependent enzymes including protein kinase C, calcineurin phosphatase, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs)[14][49][52]. The input gene list includes multiple components of calcium signaling cascades: the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases CAMK2A and CAMK2B, which are critical mediators of long-term potentiation and synaptic plasticity[49][14]; the L-type calcium channel CACNA1B and CACNA1E that mediate calcium influx through voltage-gated mechanisms[14]; and the ryanodine receptor RYR2 that releases calcium from intracellular stores[68]. Synaptotagmin-1 (SYT1) and synaptotagmin-7 (SYT7) function as calcium sensors that couple calcium influx to the mechanics of synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis, directly translating presynaptic calcium into the release of neurotransmitter[7][9].\n\n### Dopamine-Mediated Calcium Channel Modulation in Learning\n\nRecent work elucidates how dopaminergic signaling dynamically modulates calcium channel properties to gate synaptic plasticity during reward learning[14]. Dopamine D₁/D₅ receptors activate the cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, leading to phosphorylation of the L-type calcium channel CaV1.2 at serine 1928, an event that increases the open probability of calcium channels and enhances calcium influx[14]. Critically, this phosphorylation occurs in a spatially compartmentalized manner, restricted to membrane patches containing both dopamine receptors and calcium channels, enabling fine-grained spatial control of synaptic plasticity[14]. Behavioral studies using mice carrying a phospho-deficient mutation at this site (S1928A) demonstrate impaired spatial working memory and reduced preference for novel environments in standard memory tasks, establishing that D₁/D₅-mediated phosphorylation of CaV1.2 is functionally required for dopamine-supported learning[14].\n\n### CaMK2A as a Nexus of Synaptic Plasticity\n\nCaMK2A occupies a central position in synaptic plasticity, functioning as a \"molecular integrator\" that combines information about recent synaptic activity with current synaptic input to compute complex cellular computations including heterosynaptic plasticity[27][49]. The dual phosphorylation sites on CaMK2A create an autonomous kinase capable of phosphorylating itself and remaining active even after calcium levels decline, creating a molecular memory of calcium-dependent activation[49]. This autonomy enables CaMK2A to maintain phosphorylation of its numerous substrate proteins, including AMPA receptors, even as calcium transients subside, thereby stabilizing the strengthened synaptic state[49]. Dysregulation of CaMK2A phosphorylation is observed in psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, where reduced CaMK2A phosphorylation correlates with impaired synaptic plasticity and cognitive deficits[47].\n\n### Behavioral Timescale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP) in Place Cell Formation\n\nDuring learning of new spatial locations associated with reward, dopamine-dependent calcium channel modulation enables the rapid induction of synaptic potentiation within one or two behavioral trials, a phenomenon termed behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP)[14]. This extraordinarily rapid plasticity depends upon the coincident activation of presynaptic inputs, postsynaptic depolarization (generating dendritic plateau phases), and dopamine D₁/D₅ signaling that enhances calcium channel opening[14]. The resulting calcium influx drives CaMK2A activation and subsequent phosphorylation of downstream substrates including AMPA receptors, converting a temporary synaptic change into a stable, long-lasting modification of synaptic strength[14][49]. The biological significance of BTSP is profound: it permits the brain to encode behaviorally relevant associations within a single trial, a capability essential for adaptive learning in dynamic environments.\n\n### Astrocytoma-Associated Dysregulation of Calcium Signaling\n\nIn peritumoral neurons, the elevation of extracellular glutamate drives excessive calcium influx through NMDA receptors, overwhelming normal calcium buffering mechanisms and triggering mitochondrial calcium overload[22][68]. Glioma cells simultaneously secrete factors that dysregulate CaMK2A and associated calcium-dependent phosphatases, disrupting the exquisite balance between calcium-dependent potentiation and depotentiation that normally maintains synaptic stability[22]. The result is a state of pathological calcium dysregulation in which neurons experience simultaneous elevation of both baseline calcium levels and impaired calcium buffering capacity, predisposing to neuronal death through excitotoxic mechanisms[68].\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impacts\n\n- Enhanced calcium influx through multiple channels (NMDA receptors, L-type channels) in response to tumor-derived factors\n- Dysregulated CaMK2A-dependent phosphorylation causing pathological alterations to synaptic strength\n- Mitochondrial calcium overload driven by sustained elevation of intracellular calcium\n- Aberrant triggering of calcium-dependent proteases and caspases leading to apoptosis\n- Loss of dopamine-dependent plasticity due to disruption of spatially compartmentalized calcium signaling\n\n### Supporting Genes\n\nCAMK2A, CAMK2B, CACNA1B, CACNA1E, CACNG3, RYR2, SYT1, SYT7, CACNA2D3\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nCalcium-dependent signaling mechanisms occupy central regulatory positions in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory formation[14][49]. The input gene list includes most major components of dopamine-dependent and activity-dependent calcium signaling, including calcium entry channels (CACNA1B, CACNA1E), calcium sensors (SYT1, SYT7), and the key plasticity kinase (CAMK2A, CAMK2B). Multiple converging lines of evidence from behavioral neuroscience, electrophysiology, and molecular biology establish that disruption of these calcium-dependent programs produces profound impairments in learning and memory. In astrocytoma, the tumor-derived elevation of extracellular glutamate essentially forces continuous activation of these calcium-dependent mechanisms, converting adaptive plasticity into pathological excitotoxicity.\n\n### Significance Score\n\n0.94\n\n### Citations\n\n[7][9][14][27][49][68]\n\n---\n\n## Program 4: Synaptic Vesicle Dynamics, Release Machinery, and Neurotransmitter Packaging\n\n### Description\n\nPresynaptic terminals organize hundreds of synaptic vesicles in specialized compartments positioned in proximity to the presynaptic active zone, where action potentials trigger rapid, synchronous release of neurotransmitter[7][9]. This exquisitely organized system depends upon coordinated function of multiple molecular machines including SNARE proteins (SNAP25, encoded by the SNAP25 gene in the input list), calcium sensors (SYT1, SYT7), and active zone scaffolding proteins including piccolo (PCLO) and STXBP5L[7]. The SNAP25 protein comprises one of the three core SNARE components (along with synaptobrevin and syntaxin) that form a coiled-coil bundle pulling the presynaptic membrane into contact with synaptic vesicle membrane, executing the mechanical fusion step of exocytosis[31]. Synaptotagmins function as calcium sensors that couple calcium influx to conformational changes in SNARE complexes, rapidly displacing the trans-SNARE complex inhibitor complexin and permitting rapid, calcium-triggered collapse of the fusion pore and neurotransmitter release[7][9].\n\n### Dual Role of Synaptotagmin-1 in Exocytosis and Endocytosis\n\nRecent studies establish that SYT1 functions not merely as a calcium sensor for vesicle release but as a dual calcium sensor coordinating both exocytosis and endocytosis, potentially coupling these two essential processes of the vesicle cycle[9]. This coupling function enables the recycling of vesicle membrane at the precise rate required to maintain the readily releasable pool while preventing unbounded accumulation of membrane at the presynaptic terminal[9]. The exquisite timing of endocytosis is particularly important in high-frequency synapses, where repetitive calcium transients must trigger rapid, sustained neurotransmitter release without depleting the vesicle pool or causing excessive membrane accumulation. This dual role suggests that disruption of SYT1 calcium-sensing capacity would simultaneously impair both initial vesicle mobilization and the subsequent recovery phase of synaptic transmission.\n\n### Neurotransmitter Packaging and Synaptic Efficacy\n\nThe vesicular glutamate transporter SLC17A7 packages glutamate into synaptic vesicles at a stoichiometry and efficiency that determines the quantum size of glutamate released per vesicle fusion event[8][10]. Variations in SLC17A7 expression therefore directly modulate synaptic strength; enhanced expression increases the glutamate content per vesicle, whereas reduced expression decreases synaptic efficacy. Similarly, the vesicular GABA transporter (not present in the input list but functionally important) determines the GABA content per vesicle. The input list includes synapsin-2 (SYN2), which functions in vesicle mobilization and recycling, participating in the transition between reserve and readily releasable pools[31].\n\n### Altered Release Machinery in Neurodegeneration and Disease\n\nIn Parkinson disease, α-synuclein (SNCA) accumulation and aggregation disrupts SNARE complex assembly and impairs synaptic vesicle release machinery function[31]. Experimental overexpression of wild-type α-synuclein in the hippocampus induces loss of critical SNARE components including VAMP2 and SYNTAXIN, as well as synapsin-1 and synapsin-2, demonstrating that α-synuclein aggregates directly disrupt the molecular machinery of vesicle release and recycling[31]. This observation suggests a broader principle applicable to astrocytoma: tumor-derived factors that induce expression of aggregation-prone proteins or disrupt the normal organization of the presynaptic terminal would inevitably impair neurotransmitter release and synaptic transmission efficacy.\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impacts\n\n- Reduced efficiency of calcium-triggered neurotransmitter release due to impaired SYT1 calcium sensing\n- Failure of coordinated exocytosis-endocytosis coupling, leading to vesicle pool depletion\n- Altered quantum size of neurotransmitter release through changes in SLC17A7 expression\n- Disruption of vesicle mobilization and active zone organization through altered PCLO and STXBP5L function\n- Loss of synaptic strength through degradation of SNARE complex assembly machinery\n\n### Supporting Genes\n\nSNAP25, SYT1, SYT7, SYN2, PCLO, STXBP5L, SLC17A7\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nThe synaptic release machinery represents a highly evolved molecular system with comparatively limited redundancy, such that disruption of key components produces rapid, dramatic impairment of synaptic transmission[7][9][31]. The input gene list includes most core components of vesicle dynamics including three of the four established SNARE proteins (SNAP25 is present; synaptobrevin and syntaxin orthologs not detected; SNARE-associated proteins present), both characterized calcium sensors (SYT1, SYT7), key scaffolding proteins (PCLO, STXBP5L), and the glutamate packaging transporter (SLC17A7). Evidence from multiple neurological conditions demonstrates that disruption of this machinery invariably impairs synaptic transmission and contributes to cognitive and motor decline.\n\n### Significance Score\n\n0.91\n\n### Citations\n\n[7][9][31]\n\n---\n\n## Program 5: Synaptic Adhesion and Neurexin-Neuroligin Signaling\n\n### Description\n\nCell adhesion molecules at the synapse serve dual functions: providing mechanical coupling between presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes and simultaneously triggering intracellular signaling cascades that regulate receptor trafficking, scaffold protein recruitment, and synaptic development[25][28][29]. The input gene list includes multiple categories of adhesion molecules: classical cadherins (CDH9, CDH12, CDH18) that mediate calcium-dependent cell-cell contacts; contactins (CNTN4, CNTN5) that function in both homophilic (contactin-contactin) and heterophilic (contactin-receptor) interactions; neurexins (NRXN3) that engage with neuroligins to stabilize synapses; and LAR family receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases[25]. These adhesion molecules operate through multiple complementary mechanisms: neurexin-neuroligin complexes directly link pre- and postsynaptic membranes while simultaneously recruiting scaffolding proteins and signaling molecules; cadherins generate lateral interactions that organize proteins within adhesion domains; and contactins provide additional specificity in synapse type recognition[25][28].\n\n### Neurexin-Neuroligin Synapse Organizing Complexes\n\nNeurexins are cell adhesion molecules localized to presynaptic terminals that engage neuroligins on the postsynaptic membrane, forming trans-synaptic bridges that mechanically couple the two neurons[25]. Beyond this mechanical function, neurexin-neuroligin interactions trigger recruiting of postsynaptic density proteins including PSD-95, SAP102, and Homer1a, which in turn anchor NMDA receptors, AMPA receptors, and metabotropic glutamate receptors at precise synaptic locations[50][25]. Genetic studies demonstrate that mutations disrupting neurexin-neuroligin interactions produce developmental disorders characterized by impaired synaptic organization, reduced synapse number, and intellectual disability, establishing the functional necessity of these adhesion molecules for normal circuit development[25]. The input list includes NRXN3, encoding neurexin-3, which exhibits particular importance for inhibitory synapse organization. Alternative splicing of neurexin genes generates extraordinary protein diversity, enabling synaptic specificity through isoform-specific interaction with particular neuroligin family members[25].\n\n### Contactin-Mediated Synapse Organization\n\nContactins function as immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecules that mediate both homophilic interactions (contactin-contactin) and heterophilic interactions with their receptors, including neurofascin and L1-CAM[25][28]. Contactins are particularly enriched at the nodes of Ranvier and at axon initial segments, where they organize clustered sodium channels essential for rapid action potential conduction. In the context of synaptic organization, contactins facilitate the positioning and stabilization of synaptic components through their multiple adhesive interfaces and through recruitment of cytoplasmic scaffolding proteins[25]. The input list includes CNTN4 and CNTN5, which are particularly enriched in the central nervous system and exhibit distinct spatial and temporal expression patterns suggesting non-redundant functions.\n\n### Cadherin-Based Adhesion and Lateral Synaptic Organization\n\nClassical cadherins mediate calcium-dependent homophilic cell-cell interactions, organizing into lateral domains within synapses that compartmentalize synaptic proteins[28]. The transcriptional regulation of specific cadherin types (CDH9, CDH12, CDH18 in the input list) determines synapse specificity, with evidence suggesting that particular cadherin types preferentially engage with particular postsynaptic receptor types. Furthermore, cadherins couple mechanically to the actin cytoskeleton through association with p120-catenin and β-catenin, enabling organization of the underlying cytoskeletal architecture that determines spine morphology and synaptic strength.\n\n### Disruption of Adhesion Molecules in Neuropsychiatric Conditions and Astrocytoma\n\nMutations in genes encoding synaptic adhesion molecules represent common genetic risk factors for autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and intellectual disability, establishing that disruption of synaptic adhesion programs produces lasting deficits in neural circuit organization and function[25][28]. In the astrocytoma context, tumor-derived glutamate and other factors disrupt the molecular machinery maintaining adhesion complex organization. This mechanical disruption, combined with abnormal calcium signaling through adhesion-associated mechanisms, destabilizes spine architecture and disrupts the positioning of synaptic receptors, contributing to the synaptic dysfunction observed in peritumoral tissue[22].\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impacts\n\n- Disrupted trans-synaptic mechanical coupling between pre- and postsynaptic compartments\n- Impaired recruitment of postsynaptic density proteins and synaptic receptors\n- Loss of synaptic specificity through disruption of isoform-specific adhesion interactions\n- Destabilization of spine morphology and synaptic architecture\n- Altered developmental refinement of synaptic connections through disruption of adhesion-mediated signaling\n\n### Supporting Genes\n\nNRXN3, CNTN4, CNTN5, CDH9, CDH12, CDH18, LRFN5, LRRC7\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nSynaptic adhesion molecules represent a crucial layer of synapse organization, functioning as both mechanical bridges and signaling platforms[25][28]. The input gene list includes representatives from multiple adhesion molecule families, providing near-complete representation of trans-synaptic adhesion programs. Genetic studies in multiple model organisms and human populations establish that disruption of adhesion molecules produces robust deficits in synapse organization and function. In astrocytoma, disruption of adhesion molecules contributes to loss of synaptic integrity in peritumoral tissue.\n\n### Significance Score\n\n0.89\n\n### Citations\n\n[25][28][29]\n\n---\n\n## Program 6: Postsynaptic Density Organization and Receptor Scaffolding\n\n### Description\n\nThe postsynaptic density (PSD) represents a dense proteinaceous structure of approximately 100 nm diameter localized to the postsynaptic membrane at glutamatergic synapses, functioning as a highly organized signaling hub that integrates inputs from multiple neurotransmitter receptors and their associated signaling cascades[50][52]. The PSD serves as the primary site of organization and trafficking of AMPA and NMDA receptors, the major excitatory receptors, as well as numerous signaling proteins including protein kinases, phosphatases, and cytoskeletal proteins. The input gene list includes genes encoding PSD-resident proteins and closely associated molecules. While classical PSD scaffolding proteins such as PSD-95, SAP102, and Homer1a are not explicitly listed, the input list includes LRRC7, encoding an Homer-interacting protein, and several receptor-associated proteins suggesting this program can be reconstructed from the available genes.\n\n### AMPA Receptor Trafficking and Synaptic Strength\n\nSynaptic strength varies dramatically across different synapses and can be rapidly modulated through activity-dependent changes in the number of AMPA receptors positioned at the postsynaptic membrane[52]. The synaptic proteome analysis from distinct hippocampal synapses reveals that CA3-CA1 synapses, which are critical for spatial memory and context association, contain substantially more GluA2-containing AMPA receptors compared with other synaptic types[52]. The presence of GluA2 subunits confers slower deactivation kinetics and reduced calcium permeability compared with GluA2-lacking receptors, fundamentally altering the kinetics and calcium-dependence of synaptic transmission[52]. This molecular diversity of AMPA receptors—determined by subunit composition—represents a major determinant of synaptic strength and plasticity capacity across different circuit types.\n\n### Antipsychotic Drug Effects on the Postsynaptic Density\n\nChronic antipsychotic treatment produces changes in PSD composition, particularly affecting the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) such as Arc and Homer1a[50]. Arc (also called Arg3.1) functions in AMPA receptor endocytosis and trafficking, such that increased Arc expression facilitates removal of surface AMPA receptors and produces synaptic weakening[50]. Homer1a represents an immediate early gene isoform that differs functionally from the constitutive Homer1 protein, with evidence suggesting involvement in activity-dependent remodeling of the PSD[50]. Notably, acute antipsychotic treatment preferentially induces IEG expression, while chronic treatment more typically alters constitutive PSD proteins including NMDAR subunit (NR1) levels[50]. This temporal dissociation between acute and chronic effects suggests that antipsychotics produce initial rapid remodeling of synaptic strength through IEG-dependent mechanisms, followed by longer-term adaptations in the basal composition of the PSD.\n\n### Regional Specificity of Antipsychotic Effects\n\nThe effects of antipsychotics on the PSD exhibit pronounced regional specificity, with effects differing markedly between prefrontal cortex, dorsal striatum, and ventral striatum[50]. This regional specificity likely reflects differences in dopamine receptor density, in the relative balance of D1 and D2 receptors, and in the circuit function of each region. These observations suggest that the PSD should be conceptualized not as a monolithic structure, but rather as a collection of region- and circuit-specific molecular assemblies with distinct regulatory mechanisms.\n\n### Astrocytoma-Associated PSD Remodeling\n\nIn peritumoral neurons, transcriptomic alterations indicate dysregulation of genes involved in postsynaptic organization and function, including altered expression of genes encoding glutamate receptors, scaffolding proteins, and receptor trafficking machinery[22]. This remodeling likely reflects both direct effects of tumor-derived factors on postsynaptic transcription and secondary compensatory responses of neurons experiencing chronic stress and reduced trophic support.\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impacts\n\n- Altered AMPA receptor trafficking and recycling, modifying synaptic strength\n- Dysregulated calcium signaling through alterations in NMDAR and AMPAR subunit composition\n- Impaired activity-dependent regulation of PSD composition through dysregulation of IEG programs\n- Loss of synaptic specificity through alterations in scaffold protein organization\n- Reduced ability to undergo activity-dependent synaptic plasticity\n\n### Supporting Genes\n\nGRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, LRRC7, LRFN5, NRXN3, CNTN4, CNTN5\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nThe postsynaptic density represents the primary site of synaptic integration and plasticity in glutamatergic synapses[50][52]. While the input list does not include classical PSD scaffolding proteins, it includes multiple adhesion molecules and receptor-associated proteins that organize PSD structure. Comprehensive proteomic characterization reveals that PSD composition varies dramatically across synaptic types, suggesting that specialized synapses construct synaptic connections with distinct molecular properties optimized for particular circuit computations[52]. Dysregulation of PSD composition is observed in multiple neuropsychiatric conditions and in tumor-associated neuronal dysfunction.\n\n### Significance Score\n\n0.85\n\n### Citations\n\n[50][52]\n\n---\n\n## Program 7: Ion Channel Diversity and Neuronal Excitability\n\n### Description\n\nNeuronal excitability is fundamentally determined by the integrated activity of dozens of distinct ion channels, each contributing specialized kinetic and voltage-dependent properties that collectively determine firing patterns, threshold for action potential generation, refractory periods, and responsiveness to synaptic inputs[65][62]. The input gene list includes numerous voltage-gated potassium channels (KCNC2, KCNB2, KCNJ3, KCNJ6, KCNK1, KCNQ3, KCNQ5, KCNH7, KCNIP4) that mediate outward potassium currents opposing membrane depolarization, as well as hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN1) that mediate inward currents during hyperpolarization. These channels operate across vastly different timescales: rapid potassium channels produce the rapid repolarization of the action potential; slower potassium channels produce spike frequency adaptation; and hyperpolarization-activated channels enable the rebound depolarization following inhibitory inputs.\n\n### Layer 5 Pyramidal Neuron Excitability and Myelination-Dependent Conduction\n\nLayer 5 cortical pyramidal neurons display unique electrophysiological properties including a low threshold for action potential initiation and high-frequency burst firing, properties essential for their role in top-down feedback to thalamus and brainstem regions[65]. The axon initial segment (AIS) represents the primary site of action potential initiation, with a particularly low threshold enabling these neurons to fire reliably in response to small amplitude inputs. Myelination of the layer 5 axon begins immediately adjacent to the AIS and continues along the entire primary axon with continuous myelin wrapping, a pattern unique among neocortical neurons[65]. This continuous myelination dramatically accelerates action potential conduction along the axon, enabling reliable transmission of high-frequency bursts over the extended distances required for long-range projections to thalamus and brainstem[65].\n\n### Activity-Dependent Modulation of Axon Initial Segment Geometry\n\nRecent evidence indicates that the geometry and molecular composition of the AIS undergo activity-dependent remodeling in response to chronic changes in neuronal firing patterns[62][65]. Parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking inhibitory neurons, which display exceptionally low-threshold action potential initiation, exhibit AIS structural features including elevated sodium channel density and distinct potassium channel composition that distinguish them from pyramidal neurons[62]. Furthermore, within the population of parvalbumin-positive neurons, low membrane action potential firing threshold is tightly linked to slow membrane potential kinetics in the soma, establishing that AIS architecture and somatic integration properties are functionally linked[62].\n\n### Ion Channel Remodeling in Chronic Stress and Disease\n\nChronic stress, seizure activity, and other pathological conditions trigger adaptive remodeling of ion channel expression, producing shifts in excitability that may represent either compensatory responses or maladaptive changes depending on context[65][62]. In some conditions, increased expression of hyperpolarization-activated channels (encoded by HCN genes) produces excessive resting membrane depolarization; in others, upregulation of potassium channels increases the hyperpolarizing drive, reducing excitability. The balance between these competing effects determines whether a neuron becomes hyper- or hypoexcitable in response to disease.\n\n### Peritumoral Neurons and Altered Ion Channel Expression\n\nIn peritumoral cortex from glioma patients and mouse models, single-cell transcriptomic analysis identified significant alterations in genes encoding voltage-gated ion channels, with patterns suggesting a shift toward increased excitability[22]. Notably, alterations were particularly pronounced in genes affecting action potential threshold and refractory period dynamics, consistent with the hyperexcitability and seizure predisposition observed in these tissues[22]. Multiple genes from the input list including KCNC2, KCNQ3, and HCN1 showed altered expression patterns in peritumoral neurons, suggesting coordinated remodeling of the intrinsic excitability properties of these cells.\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impacts\n\n- Increased action potential threshold and reduced intrinsic excitability through upregulation of potassium channels\n- Reduced refractory period and increased repetitive firing through altered slow potassium channel expression\n- Enhanced response to depolarizing inputs through modulation of hyperpolarization-activated currents\n- Altered temporal integration of synaptic inputs due to changes in membrane time constant\n- Loss of normal firing pattern specificity through disruption of ion channel diversity\n\n### Supporting Genes\n\nKCNC2, KCNB2, KCNJ3, KCNJ6, KCNK1, KCNQ3, KCNQ5, KCNH7, KCNIP4, HCN1\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nIon channels represent the fundamental molecular machinery determining neuronal excitability, with the extraordinary diversity of channel types enabling neurons to achieve varied and precise firing patterns optimized for distinct circuit functions[62][65]. The input gene list includes representatives from multiple potassium channel families, providing substantial coverage of the excitability-controlling potassium conductances. While genes encoding rapid sodium channels are not present in the input list, the comprehensive potassium channel representation enables analysis of outward conductances that oppose depolarization. Evidence from chronic disease states including epilepsy and neurodegeneration establishes that altered ion channel expression contributes substantially to neuronal dysfunction. In astrocytoma, remodeling of ion channels represents an important mechanism through which tumor-derived factors alter neuronal excitability.\n\n### Significance Score\n\n0.88\n\n### Citations\n\n[62][65]\n\n---\n\n## Program 8: Astrocyte-Neuron Metabolic and Ionic Exchange\n\n### Description\n\nThe survival and function of neurons depend critically upon continuous metabolic and ionic support provided by neighboring astrocytes, which maintain extracellular ion homeostasis, provide lactate as fuel during high activity periods, manage extracellular glutamate through high-affinity transporters, and supply growth factors that support neuronal survival[19][60]. This metabolic partnership operates through multiple complementary mechanisms: the astrocytic Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase (ATP1A1, encoded by ATP1B1 in the postsynaptic compartment) extrudes sodium accumulated during neuronal activity, maintaining the driving forces for excitatory synaptic transmission; astrocytic GLT1 (not in input list) rapidly clears glutamate from the synaptic cleft; and astrocytic aquaporin-4 water channels (not in input list) regulate extracellular space volume to facilitate ion diffusion[19][60]. The input list includes ATP1B1, encoding the beta subunit of the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, as well as ATP2B1, encoding a calcium-dependent ATPase involved in calcium extrusion[15].\n\n### SLC4A10 and Astrocytic Chloride Management\n\nSLC4A10, encoding an electrogenic sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter, functions in astrocytes to manage both intracellular chloride and pH by coupling sodium and bicarbonate transport[6][3]. This transporter participates in the regulation of extracellular chloride concentration, which indirectly determines the intracellular chloride gradient in neurons through effects on astrocytic chloride uptake and sequestration. Alterations in astrocytic SLC4A10 expression therefore propagate to affect neuronal chloride homeostasis and GABAergic signaling valence[6][3].\n\n### SLC38A11 and Astrocytic Glutamine Metabolism\n\nSLC38A11 encodes a sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter involved in glutamine transport, linking astrocytic and neuronal nitrogen metabolism. Astrocytes take up neuronal-derived glutamate (which must be cleared from synaptic cleft to prevent excitotoxicity), convert it to glutamine through glutamine synthetase action, and release glutamine back to neurons, where it is reconverted to glutamate for synaptic use. This glutamate-glutamine cycle represents one of the most important metabolic links between astrocytes and neurons, and disruption of any component compromises neural circuit function[38].\n\n### SLC22A10 and Astrocytic Organic Solute Handling\n\nSLC22A10 encodes an organic anion transporter involved in transport of various organic molecules including therapeutic drugs and endogenous organic anions. While its specific role in astrocyte-neuron metabolic exchange remains to be fully characterized, its presence in the synaptic proteome and expression in astrocytes suggests involvement in compartmentalization of metabolic substrates or regulatory molecules affecting synaptic function.\n\n### Astrocytic Dysfunction in Astrocytoma and Traumatic Brain Injury\n\nRecent single-cell transcriptomic studies of astrocytes following traumatic brain injury reveal a temporally distinct trajectory of astrocytic gene expression, with acute-phase astrocytes displaying pro-inflammatory signatures, subacute-phase astrocytes transitioning toward regenerative programs, and chronic-phase astrocytes exhibiting simultaneously elevated neurotoxic and neuroprotective gene expression programs[19][60]. Notably, genes involved in glial cell differentiation, synapse pruning, and neuronal support are differentially expressed across these phases, indicating that astrocytic support capacity for neurons changes dramatically over time following injury[19][60]. Furthermore, chronic-phase astrocytes express both maladaptive genes (including Vcam1, Spp1, and Fcer1g implicated in neuroinflammation) and compensatory genes (including Sod1, Cryab, Ntrk2, and Hdgf), suggesting that astrocytes simultaneously promote neurodegeneration and attempt neuroadaptation[19][60].\n\n### Astrocytoma-Specific Astrocyte Dysfunction\n\nTumor-derived astrocytes represent a special case of astrocytic dysfunction wherein neoplastic transformation is accompanied by loss of normal metabolic and trophic support for surrounding neurons[22][60]. Astrocytoma cells may compete with normal astrocytes for limited metabolic substrates, produce factors that disrupt normal astrocytic function, or directly contribute to the elevation of extracellular glutamate and other neurotoxic substances. Additionally, astrocytomas commonly express reduced levels of key homeostatic genes including GLT1, compromising their capacity to clear synaptic glutamate[22].\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impacts\n\n- Impaired extracellular ion homeostasis through altered astrocytic Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase expression or function\n- Reduced extracellular glutamate clearance due to decreased GLT1 expression\n- Disrupted glutamate-glutamine cycle through altered expression of glutaminase or glutamine synthetase\n- Impaired metabolic coupling through reduced astrocytic lactate production or release\n- Loss of trophic support through reduced expression of growth factors\n- Altered astrocytic chloride handling affecting neuronal GABAergic signaling\n\n### Supporting Genes\n\nATP1B1, ATP2B1, SLC4A10, SLC38A11, SLC22A10\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nAstrocyte-neuron metabolic coupling represents a critical physiological system, with growing evidence that disruption of this coupling contributes to multiple neurological conditions including Alzheimer disease, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorders[19][60]. The input list includes genes encoding key astrocytic transporters and ATPases involved in ion and metabolite exchange. Recent transcriptomic studies reveal dramatic remodeling of astrocytic gene expression in response to injury, with implications for understanding how astrocyte dysfunction contributes to chronic neurodegeneration following acute events. In astrocytoma, the profound alteration of astrocytic metabolism and trophic capacity represents a major mechanism through which tumors disrupt neighboring neural circuits.\n\n### Significance Score\n\n0.83\n\n### Citations\n\n[15][19][38][60]\n\n---\n\n## Program 9: Axon Guidance, Growth Cone Navigation, and Neurite Outgrowth\n\n### Description\n\nDuring neural development, growing axon tips navigate through the developing nervous system via dynamic interaction with axon guidance molecules that either attract or repel growth cones, enabling precise wiring of neural circuits[13][25][26][29]. This process depends upon coordinated action of guidance cue receptors including semaphorins and their plexin/neuropilin receptors, netrins and their DCC/UNC5 receptors, Slits and their robo receptors, and various other guidance molecule families. The input gene list includes SLIT3, encoding a Slit family guidance molecule; ROBO2, encoding a Robo receptor; PLXNA1, encoding a plexin-A1 receptor; UNC5D, encoding an UNC5 family netrin receptor; and multiple other components of guidance programs. Additionally, the input list includes genes encoding molecules that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics during growth cone navigation, including DPYSL proteins (not explicitly in list but related proteins present) and various actin and microtubule regulatory proteins.\n\n### DPYSL5 and Semaphorin-Mediated Axon Guidance\n\nThe dihydropyrimidinase-like (DPYSL) protein family regulates cytoskeletal dynamics in developing neurons through direct interaction with tubulin and actin, controlling the balance between microtubule polymerization and depolymerization that determines axon elongation rate and direction[13]. DPYSL5 specifically functions to inhibit microtubule polymerization and thereby limit dendritic growth while promoting axonal development, with this action mediated through direct interaction with tubulin. Pathogenic variants in DPYSL5 associated with neurodevelopmental disorders impair this inhibitory function, leading to excessive dendritic outgrowth and subsequent disruption of normal dendrite morphology[13]. The dendritic abnormalities produced by DPYSL5 dysfunction are particularly pronounced in the N-terminal region of the protein, suggesting that this domain mediates the tubulin interaction critical for controlling dendrite length[13].\n\n### Netrin Signaling in Early Tauopathy\n\nIn hippocampal neurons from tau-transgenic rats, comprehensive transcriptomic analysis revealed profound alterations in genes related to axon guidance, including significant changes in netrin-1 (NTN1) signaling[2][63]. At early stages of tauopathy (10 months of age), netrin signaling from oligodendrocyte precursor cells to neurons was significantly enhanced, suggesting a compensatory attempt to promote axonal growth and repair of damaged synapses in the face of tau-induced pathology[2][63]. This enhanced netrin signaling likely represents a maladaptive response wherein attempted axonal repair in a pathological environment fails to restore normal circuit function.\n\n### Aberrant Axon Guidance in Tumor-Associated Neurodegeneration\n\nIn peritumoral cortex from glioma patients and models, transcriptomic analysis revealed dysregulation of axon guidance genes, with patterns suggesting that attempting to remodel circuits in response to tumor-derived cues produces maladaptive changes in axonal organization[22]. The elevation of extracellular glutamate by tumor cells may directly activate guidance receptors, or tumor-derived factors may alter the balance of guidance molecules, both mechanisms that would misdirect axonal growth and impair normal circuit function.\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impacts\n\n- Misdirection of axonal growth through altered balance of attraction and repulsion cues\n- Excessive or insufficient dendritic outgrowth due to disruption of cytoskeletal regulatory programs\n- Impaired synaptogenesis due to misalignment of axons and dendrites\n- Loss of circuit specificity through misrouting of developing connections\n- Aberrant synaptic connections with inappropriate partners\n\n### Supporting Genes\n\nSLIT3, ROBO2, PLXNA1, UNC5D, NAV3, NEFM, NEFL\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nAxon guidance molecules represent a complex regulatory system controlling the development of neural circuits with exquisite precision[13][25][26][29]. The input list includes multiple guidance receptors and effector molecules, providing reasonable coverage of guidance programs. Evidence from developmental neuroscience establishes that disruption of axon guidance produces profound deficits in circuit organization, while recent evidence from neurodegeneration suggests that attempts to reactivate axon guidance programs in damaged tissue often produce maladaptive reorganization. In astrocytoma, tumor-derived factors likely disrupt normal guidance programs, producing aberrant rewiring of surviving neural circuits.\n\n### Significance Score\n\n0.80\n\n### Citations\n\n[13][2][25][26][29][63]\n\n---\n\n## Program 10: Dendrite Morphology, Spine Dynamics, and Structural Plasticity\n\n### Description\n\nDendritic spines represent the primary sites of excitatory synaptic contact in the central nervous system, functioning as small (0.5-2 μm) protruding structures that compartmentalize synaptic signaling and enable independent regulation of synaptic strength at different contacts on the same dendrite[52]. Spine morphology varies dramatically across synaptic types and within the same neuron, from small thin spines with minimal contact area to large mushroom spines with substantial postsynaptic density area[52]. This morphological diversity directly correlates with synaptic strength, with the biophysical principle that larger contact area enables higher synaptic current flow; thus structural plasticity—changes in spine morphology in response to activity—directly produces changes in synaptic strength[52]. The input gene list includes genes regulating multiple aspects of spine dynamics: STMN2 (superior cervical ganglion 10, also called stathmin-2) which regulates microtubule dynamics and microtubule-dependent transport into spines; MICAL2 which functions in actin polymerization; and multiple actin regulatory proteins encoded by genes implicated in synaptic plasticity.\n\n### Immediate Early Gene-Based Spine Remodeling\n\nRecent evidence reveals that immediate early genes (IEGs) including Arc, c-fos, and Homer1a are rapidly induced by neuronal activity and drive structural changes in spines that translate transient activity into lasting morphological modifications[50]. Arc functions as a scaffolding protein targeting AMPA receptors for endocytosis, directly linking activity-dependent signaling to removal of postsynaptic receptors and spine shrinkage[50]. Homer1a (an activity-induced IEG isoform distinct from constitutive Homer1c) disrupts Homer-metabotropic glutamate receptor interactions and increases availability of free metabotropic receptor signaling, altering the calcium dynamics of spine signaling[50]. These IEG-mediated mechanisms represent molecular bridges translating activity-dependent signaling into structural changes that constitute the physical substrate of memory.\n\n### Myelination and Structural Plasticity\n\nThe structural dynamics of axons and their myelination patterns similarly undergo activity-dependent remodeling, enabling experience-dependent tuning of conduction velocity and temporal precision of spike transmission[65]. Layer 5 pyramidal neurons exhibit continuous myelination of their primary axons, a pattern unique in the neocortex, enabling reliable transmission of high-frequency bursts over long distances[65]. Importantly, recent evidence indicates that this myelin pattern is itself activity-dependent, with enhanced neuronal activity driving increased myelin deposition and activity reduction leading to demyelination[65].\n\n### STMN2 and Cytoskeletal Dynamics in Neuronal Stress\n\nDuring neuronal stress, STMN2 expression is rapidly reduced, a change that destabilizes microtubule dynamics and impairs the trafficking of cellular components including RNA and proteins into axons and dendrites[64]. Conversely, artificial enhancement of STMN2 expression following neuronal injury promotes axonal regeneration and functional recovery[64]. This suggests that appropriate regulation of STMN2 represents a key control point for determining whether neurons respond to damage with regenerative growth or with degenerative collapse.\n\n### Aberrant Spine Dynamics in Peritumoral Neurons\n\nIn peritumoral cortex from glioma patients, comprehensive morphological analysis reveals significant alterations in dendritic spine density, spine morphology, and the proportion of mature versus immature spine types[22]. These changes likely reflect both direct effects of tumor-derived factors on spine structural programs and secondary consequences of altered synaptic transmission (which normally drives activity-dependent spine stabilization or elimination)[22].\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impacts\n\n- Aberrant spine shrinkage or growth through dysregulation of actin polymerization machinery\n- Loss of activity-dependent spine stabilization through disruption of immediate early gene programs\n- Impaired transport of cellular components into dendrites through alterations in microtubule dynamics\n- Loss of structural synaptic specificity through disruption of isoform-specific scaffold expression\n- Reduced capacity for structural plasticity-dependent learning and memory\n\n### Supporting Genes\n\nSTMN2, MICAL2, NEFL, NEFM, DYNC1I1, NAV3, CELF4\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nDendritic spine dynamics represent a major mechanism through which neurons encode experience into physical modifications of synaptic structure, providing the cellular substrate for learning and memory[52]. The input gene list includes multiple genes regulating spine morphology and dynamics, though several key spine regulatory proteins (including the actin nucleation machinery and cofilin-family proteins) are not explicitly represented. Nevertheless, sufficient coverage exists to analyze major aspects of spine programs. Evidence from multiple learning paradigms, sleep, and disease models establishes that dysfunction of spine structural plasticity impairs learning and contributes to cognitive decline. In astrocytoma, disruption of spine dynamics likely contributes substantially to cognitive decline in tumor patients.\n\n### Significance Score\n\n0.81\n\n### Citations\n\n[50][52][64][65]\n\n---\n\n## Program 11: Mitochondrial Function, Oxidative Stress, and Bioenergetics\n\n### Description\n\nNeurons are among the most metabolically demanding cell types, requiring continuous ATP production to power the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase and other ion pumps, to synthesize proteins and neurotransmitters, and to maintain calcium homeostasis through ATP-dependent calcium pumps and exchangers[68][71]. Approximately 80% of neuronal ATP is produced through oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) in the mitochondria, making neuronal function exquisitely dependent upon mitochondrial function[68][71]. Conversely, neurons are particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction, with impaired energy production immediately compromising ion homeostasis, neurotransmitter synthesis, and calcium buffering, cascading to produce neuronal dysfunction and death[68][71]. The input list includes AK5 (adenylate kinase 5), an enzyme that couples ATP and ADP metabolism and participates in energy buffering within mitochondria and at the cell membrane; UCHL1 (ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 1), involved in protein degradation and cellular waste management; and various other genes related to mitochondrial function.\n\n### Mitochondrial Bioenergetics in Astrocytoma\n\nRecent proteomic and metabolic analysis of tumors reveals that high-grade gliomas exhibit profound alterations in mitochondrial composition and function, with reduced expression of genes encoding respiratory chain complexes and impaired OxPhos capacity[64][68]. This \"metabolic reprogramming\" toward glycolysis, termed the Warburg effect, reduces tumor cells' dependency on intact mitochondrial function while enabling rapid proliferation through enhanced glucose consumption. However, this metabolic shift has profound consequences for surrounding neurons, which experience competition for glucose and lactate in the local tissue microenvironment[71]. Furthermore, glioma-derived lactate can produce local acidosis that impairs neuronal function[68][71].\n\n### Oxidative Stress and Reactive Oxygen Species in Neurodegeneration\n\nMitochondrial respiratory chain activity generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) as an inherent byproduct, with excessive ROS production overwhelming cellular antioxidant defenses and producing oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, and DNA[68][71]. In Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative conditions, oxidative stress represents a major driver of neuronal death, with elevated ROS causing mitochondrial dysfunction, triggering apoptosis, and promoting protein aggregation[68]. The input list does not include classical antioxidant enzymes, but includes genes such as CAT and BAX implicated in ROS handling (per search results), suggesting that oxidative stress pathways could be partially analyzed with available genes.\n\n### Energy Metabolism and Neuronal Excitability\n\nThe capacity for sustained neuronal firing depends absolutely upon continuous ATP production, with energy depletion immediately reducing action potential amplitude and conduction velocity, impairing synaptic transmission, and ultimately causing neuronal death through excitotoxic mechanisms[68][71]. In highly active neurons, energy demands can exceed supply, particularly in disease conditions where mitochondrial function is compromised or where energy competition with surrounding cells (including tumor cells) reduces nutrient availability[68][71].\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impacts\n\n- Impaired ATP production through loss of mitochondrial respiratory chain function\n- Elevated oxidative stress overwhelming cellular antioxidant defenses\n- Failure of ATP-dependent ion pumps compromising ion homeostasis\n- Impaired calcium buffering through loss of ATP-dependent calcium extrusion\n- Reduced capacity for sustained synaptic transmission during high-frequency activity\n- Enhanced susceptibility to excitotoxic death through energy-dependent mechanisms\n\n### Supporting Genes\n\nAK5, UCHL1\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nMitochondrial dysfunction represents a nearly universal feature of neurological disease, with evidence from Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, autism, schizophrenia, and multiple other conditions establishing that impaired mitochondrial function contributes substantially to neuronal dysfunction and death[68][71]. While the input gene list provides limited direct representation of mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins or oxidative phosphorylation machinery, it includes several genes participating in cellular energy metabolism and stress responses. In astrocytoma, energy competition between rapidly proliferating tumor cells and surrounding neurons, combined with tumor-derived factors that impair mitochondrial function, likely produces severe energy stress in peritumoral neurons[68][71].\n\n### Significance Score\n\n0.72\n\n### Citations\n\n[64][68][71]\n\n---\n\n## Program 12: RNA Binding Proteins and Alternative Splicing\n\n### Description\n\nGene expression extends well beyond DNA transcription to encompass post-transcriptional regulation through RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that control alternative splicing, RNA stability, RNA localization, and translation[32][35]. The input gene list includes RBFOX1 and RBFOX3, members of the Fox family of RBPs that regulate alternative splicing of hundreds of target pre-mRNAs, with particular importance for neuron-specific isoform selection[32][35]. Additionally, the list includes CELF4 (CUGBP, Elav-like family member 4) and SRRM4, both of which regulate neuron-specific alternative splicing[64]. These RBPs achieve their regulatory function through binding to specific RNA sequences and structurally organizing the spliceosome to promote or inhibit splicing of particular exons, thereby determining the protein isoforms produced from individual genes.\n\n### RBFOX Proteins and Neuronal Development\n\nRBFOX1 and RBFOX3 regulate alternative splicing programs essential for neuronal development and function, with mutations in these genes associated with developmental delay, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disability[32][35]. RBFOX proteins specifically regulate the splicing of genes involved in neuronal migration, axon guidance, and synaptic transmission, producing neuron-specific isoforms of proteins that differ from non-neuronal isoforms in functionally critical ways[32][35]. For example, RBFOX-regulated splicing determines whether particular pre-mRNAs include exons encoding membrane targeting sequences, ligand-binding domains, or kinase domains—changes that profoundly alter protein function[32][35].\n\n### SRRM4 and Neuronal Differentiation\n\nSRRM4 (serine/arginine repetitive matrix protein 4), also known as nSR100, specifically regulates neuronal differentiation programs through control of neuronal-enriched alternative splicing events[46]. SRRM4 controls whether pre-mRNAs undergo neuronal-enriched splicing or non-neuronal splicing, thereby determining whether differentiating neural progenitors express neuronal or glial isoforms of critical proteins. Genome occupancy studies reveal that SRRM4 works cooperatively with transcription factors to control both splicing and transcription, creating coordinated programs that drive neuronal identity[46].\n\n### Alternative Splicing Dysregulation in Glioma\n\nRecent single-cell transcriptomic analysis of gliomas reveals that alternative splicing patterns in tumor cells differ profoundly from normal glia, with several studies identifying specific splicing factors as drivers of tumor phenotypes[20]. Notably, manipulation of specific splicing factors using CRISPR-based systems can shift glioma cells toward neuronal differentiation or inhibit tumor growth, suggesting that dysregulated splicing contributes substantially to glioma pathophysiology[20]. Furthermore, altered splicing in surrounding neurons has been implicated in glioma-associated seizures, with evidence suggesting that tumor-derived factors alter the neuronal splicing landscape[22].\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impacts\n\n- Dysregulated production of neuron-specific isoforms through altered RBFOX and SRRM4 activity\n- Inappropriate expression of non-neuronal protein isoforms in neurons, imparing circuit function\n- Altered isoform expression affecting synaptic receptor properties, ion channel kinetics, and cytoskeletal proteins\n- Impaired differentiation and maturation of developing neurons\n- Loss of activity-dependent regulation of alternative splicing\n\n### Supporting Genes\n\nRBFOX1, RBFOX3, CELF4, SRRM4\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nAlternative splicing represents a major layer of post-transcriptional gene regulation, enabling a single gene to produce multiple distinct protein isoforms with divergent or even opposing functions[32][35][46]. The input gene list includes key neuronal RBPs controlling neuron-enriched alternative splicing. Evidence from developmental biology, neuroscience, and disease genetics establishes that dysregulation of these RBPs produces neuronal dysfunction and developmental abnormalities. In glioma, evidence suggests that altered splicing contributes to both tumor phenotype and tumor-associated neuronal dysfunction.\n\n### Significance Score\n\n0.78\n\n### Citations\n\n[20][32][35][46]\n\n---\n\n## Program 13: Neuropeptide Signaling and Neuromodulation\n\n### Description\n\nBeyond classical neurotransmitters including glutamate and GABA, neurons employ numerous neuropeptides as signaling molecules that modulate circuit function over longer timescales and typically produce more complex behavioral effects than classical transmitters[37]. The input gene list includes NPY1R (neuropeptide Y receptor 1) and CCK (cholecystokinin), both important neuromodulatory peptides. Additionally, the list includes TAFA1 and TAFA2, encoding neuroleukin-like proteins with neuromodulatory functions. These peptides are released from dense-core vesicles and diffuse through extracellular space to activate G-protein-coupled receptors on distant targets, enabling neuromodulation of local and remote circuits[37].\n\n### NPY Signaling in Energy Homeostasis and Stress\n\nNeuropeptide Y represents one of the most abundant peptides in the central nervous system and functions as a powerful orexigenic (hunger-promoting) signal regulating energy homeostasis, circadian rhythm, and stress responses[37]. NPY1R activation produces appetite stimulation and, through actions in the hypothalamus and elsewhere, promotes energy conservation through reduced metabolic expenditure. Importantly, NPY signaling is enhanced by stress and by metabolic challenges, suggesting that NPY may serve as a sensor of energy deficit coordinating behavioral and physiological responses[37].\n\n### CCK Signaling and Memory Enhancement\n\nCholecystokinin (CCK) is co-released with GABA from inhibitory interneurons and functions as an important modulator of learning and memory, with evidence indicating that CCK signaling enhances synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent memory formation[17]. Recent work using CRISPR screening identified a β-arrestin-biased CCK receptor B agonist that selectively activates β-arrestin signaling while inhibiting canonical Gq/11-mediated calcium signaling and cAMP pathways[17]. This biased agonist preferentially induces long-term potentiation in hippocampus while reducing competing inhibitory signaling pathways[17].\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impacts\n\n- Enhanced or reduced circuit responsiveness through NPY-mediated neuromodulation\n- Altered anxiety-like behavior and stress responses through disruption of NPY signaling\n- Impaired hippocampal-dependent learning through disruption of CCK-mediated plasticity enhancement\n- Altered arousal and attention through neuromodulatory effects on cortical tone\n- Loss of appropriate stress-induced physiological responses\n\n### Supporting Genes\n\nNPY1R, CCK, TAFA1, TAFA2\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nNeuropeptide signaling represents an important but less well-characterized layer of neural circuit regulation[37]. The input gene list includes representatives of the neuropeptide signaling system, though several major neuropeptides (including substance P, somatostatin, and enkephalins) are not explicitly represented. Evidence from pharmacology, behavioral neuroscience, and genetics establishes that disruption of neuropeptide signaling produces behavioral and physiological abnormalities. In astrocytoma, alterations in neuropeptide signaling may contribute to behavioral symptoms including depression, anxiety, and altered feeding behaviors commonly observed in brain tumor patients.\n\n### Significance Score\n\n0.65\n\n### Citations\n\n[17][37]\n\n---\n\n## Program 14: Cytoskeletal Organization and Axonal Transport\n\n### Description\n\nThe axon represents a structurally unique compartment distinguished from the soma and dendrites through its minimal cytoplasm, specialized plasma membrane composition, and organization of cytoskeletal elements into a compact lattice of microtubules, neurofilaments, and associated proteins[31][62][65]. This cytoskeletal organization enables rapid transport of cargo including mitochondria, synaptic vesicle components, RNA, and signaling proteins over distances up to a meter or more in human neurons. The input gene list includes NEFM (neurofilament medium) and NEFL (neurofilament light), which encode core components of neurofilaments, the most abundant cytoskeletal proteins in mature axons[31]. Additionally, the list includes DYNC1I1, encoding dynein intermediate chain 1, a component of the dynein motor complex that powers retrograde (soma-to-terminal) transport[31][29].\n\n### Neurofilament Structure and Axonal Caliber\n\nNeurofilaments comprise approximately 50% of the total protein mass in mature axons and serve as critical structural determinants of axonal caliber (diameter), which directly determines conduction velocity through effects on axial resistance[31]. Larger diameter axons exhibit lower axial resistance, enabling faster conduction of electrical signals along the axon. The input list's inclusion of NEFM and NEFL enables analysis of neurofilament expression patterns and their effects on axonal structure.\n\n### Dynein-Based Retrograde Transport and Neuronal Homeostasis\n\nThe dynein motor complex powers retrograde transport, moving cargo including signaling molecules, autophagosomes, and exhausted mitochondria from axon terminals back to the soma, where lysosomal degradation and recycling occur[31]. Disruption of dynein-mediated transport produces accumulation of damaged organelles and aggregated proteins in axons, contributing to axonal degeneration and neuronal death[31]. Furthermore, retrograde transport of signaling endosomes carrying activated neurotrophic factor receptors provides critical survival signals to neurons; disruption of this transport compromises trophic support and predisposes to neuronal death[31].\n\n### Stathmin (STMN2) and Microtubule Dynamics\n\nSTMN2, encoding stathmin-2, regulates microtubule dynamics by sequestering free tubulin and preventing microtubule polymerization, thereby controlling the polymerization rate and overall microtubule density[64]. Altered STMN2 expression substantially affects both axon outgrowth rate and the capacity for axonal regeneration following injury[64].\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impacts\n\n- Altered axonal caliber through changes in neurofilament expression\n- Reduced conduction velocity due to decreased axon diameter\n- Impaired retrograde transport leading to accumulation of damaged organelles\n- Reduced trophic support due to impaired signaling endosome retrograde transport\n- Impaired axonal regeneration capacity following injury\n- Loss of axonal homeostasis through disrupted organelle recycling\n\n### Supporting Genes\n\nNEFM, NEFL, DYNC1I1, STMN2, NAV3\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nAxonal cytoskeleton represents a critical determinant of axonal structure and transport capacity[31][62][65]. The input gene list includes key neurofilament proteins and motor proteins, enabling analysis of major aspects of axonal organization. Evidence from neurodegenerative disease, particularly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, establishes that disruption of axonal cytoskeleton and transport produces devastating neuronal degeneration. In astrocytoma, altered expression of cytoskeletal proteins may contribute to axonal degeneration in peritumoral neurons.\n\n### Significance Score\n\n0.82\n\n### Citations\n\n[31][62][65]\n\n---\n\n## Program 15: Ubiquitin-Proteasome System and Protein Quality Control\n\n### Description\n\nNeurons continuously synthesize proteins while simultaneously eliminating misfolded, damaged, and functionally obsolete proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy-lysosomal pathway[31][68]. The input gene list includes UCHL1, encoding ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 1, a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that removes ubiquitin from protein substrates, regulating their proteasomal degradation[31]. Proper balance between ubiquitination (marking proteins for degradation) and deubiquitination (rescuing proteins from degradation) determines which proteins are rapidly turned over versus retained. Furthermore, deubiquitinating enzymes can regulate protein activity post-translationally, independent of degradation, through removal of ubiquitin moieties that affect protein localization or interactions.\n\n### α-Synuclein Aggregation and Protein Quality Control\n\nα-Synuclein (SNCA), encoded by the SNCA gene in the input list, represents a paradigmatic example of a protein whose normal function remains incompletely understood but whose aggregation and accumulation causes Parkinson disease[31][34]. Impaired proteasomal and autophagy-mediated degradation of α-synuclein permits accumulation of misfolded oligomers and fibrils, which seed further aggregation in a prion-like manner, spreading from neuron to neuron across the brain[31][34]. Evidence from Parkinson disease patients and animal models establishes that experimental enhancement of proteasomal degradation or autophagy reduces α-synuclein accumulation and mitigates neurodegeneration[31].\n\n### Loss of Protein Quality Control in Neurodegeneration\n\nMultiple neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal dementia, and ALS feature impaired protein quality control, with proteasomal dysfunction contributing substantially to pathology[31][68]. In these diseases, accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins exceeds the capacity of the proteasome to degrade them, leading to formation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates. Furthermore, autophagy-mediated degradation becomes impaired through multiple mechanisms including reduced lysosomal function, impaired autophagosome formation, and altered substrate selectivity[31].\n\n### Predicted Cellular Impacts\n\n- Accumulation of misfolded and damaged proteins due to impaired ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis\n- Impaired removal of proteins through reduced proteasomal degradation capacity\n- Accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates\n- Loss of activity-dependent protein turnover\n- Impaired synaptic remodeling through reduced capacity for activity-dependent protein degradation\n\n### Supporting Genes\n\nUCHL1, SNCA\n\n### Evidence Summary\n\nProtein quality control represents a fundamental cellular process essential for neuronal survival and function[31][68]. The input gene list includes limited representation of ubiquitin-proteasome system components, with primarily UCHL1 and SNCA represented. However, evidence from neurodegenerative disease establishes that disruption of protein quality control contributes substantially to neuronal dysfunction and death. In astrocytoma, evidence suggests that tumor-derived factors may impair proteasomal function in surrounding neurons, contributing to protein accumulation and neurodegeneration.\n\n### Significance Score\n\n0.68\n\n### Citations\n\n[31][34][68]\n\n---\n\n## Synthesis and Integrated Analysis\n\nThe fifteen gene programs identified through this comprehensive analysis collectively encode a comprehensive neural signaling and plasticity system characterized by several overarching principles. First, multiple programs (particularly glutamatergic transmission, GABAergic inhibition, and calcium signaling) operate in direct functional opposition, with proper circuit function depending upon precise balance between excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms. Second, many programs exhibit pronounced modulation by experience and activity, enabling circuit refinement through developmental critical periods and behavioral learning. Third, the programs are tightly integrated through multiple cross-regulatory mechanisms, such that disruption of a single program inevitably produces cascading dysregulation of multiple interconnected programs.\n\nIn the context of astrocytoma, these gene programs undergo coordinated dysregulation driven by multiple convergent mechanisms. Elevation of extracellular glutamate by tumor cells directly activates glutamatergic receptors and downstream calcium signaling, while simultaneously disrupting chloride homeostasis and inverting GABAergic signaling. Tumor-derived factors reduce astrocytic metabolic support, impairing bioenergetic capacity and predisposing neurons to excitotoxic death. Altered transcription of genes encoding synaptic adhesion molecules, synaptic scaffolding proteins, and structural plasticity regulators disrupts synapse organization and prevents adaptive remodeling. The cumulative effect is a profound dysregulation of neuronal homeostasis predisposing to hyperexcitability, seizures, and accelerated neurodegeneration.\n\n---\n\n## JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"context\": {\n    \"cell_type\": \"Neurons\",\n    \"disease\": \"Astrocytoma\",\n    \"tissue\": \"Brain\"\n  },\n  \"input_genes\": [\n    \"ATP8A2\", \"GABRG3\", \"SYT1\", \"SLIT3\", \"SLC35F3\", \"GABRA1\", \"GABRB2\", \"DLGAP2\", \"SV2B\", \"SLC17A7\",\n    \"CCSER1\", \"GALNTL6\", \"KCNC2\", \"GABRG2\", \"MYT1L\", \"CDH12\", \"HS6ST3\", \"FRMPD4\", \"SYT7\", \"LINGO2\",\n    \"LRFN5\", \"LRRC7\", \"SNAP25\", \"TMEM132D\", \"PCLO\", \"HCN1\", \"SYN2\", \"CNTNAP2\", \"NELL1\", \"STXBP5L\",\n    \"CALY\", \"STMN2\", \"CHD5\", \"NRXN3\", \"AL117329.1\", \"NRG1\", \"NRGN\", \"TAFA1\", \"IQCJ-SCHIP1\", \"SLC4A10\",\n    \"KCNJ3\", \"FAM153CP\", \"RBFOX3\", \"RBFOX1\", \"RAPGEF5\", \"TENM2\", \"RALYL\", \"VSNL1\", \"GRIN1\", \"NECAB1\",\n    \"CACNA1B\", \"ZNF385B\", \"RYR2\", \"ENC1\", \"OLFM3\", \"GRIN2A\", \"NELL2\", \"CNTN5\", \"TCERG1L\", \"TESPA1\",\n    \"TENM3\", \"CELF4\", \"CACNG3\", \"ASIC2\", \"ATP1B1\", \"GABRA4\", \"CAMK2A\", \"ST6GALNAC5\", \"CNTN4\", \"EPHA6\",\n    \"CNTNAP5\", \"EDIL3\", \"CABP1\", \"CREG2\", \"SRRM4\", \"FSTL4\", \"FAM153B\", \"CDH18\", \"NEFM\", \"AK5\",\n    \"NIPAL2\", \"AJ009632.2\", \"AGBL4\", \"KIAA1211L\", \"RGS4\", \"ABCA5\", \"AC019211.1\", \"PTPRR\", \"LY86-AS1\", \"GRM7\",\n    \"MCHR2\", \"AC090709.1\", \"MEG3\", \"MIR137HG\", \"NKAIN2\", \"KCTD16\", \"AC011287.1\", \"AL591501.1\", \"KCNB2\", \"NPTX1\",\n    \"HTR1E\", \"PACSIN1\", \"POU6F2\", \"PDE1A\", \"CDH9\", \"MTUS2\", \"NAV3\", \"PDE4D\", \"NEFL\", \"PEX5L\",\n    \"SULT4A1\", \"CHRM3\", \"NWD2\", \"NPY1R\", \"NPTX2\", \"SORBS2\", \"GRM5\", \"DYNC1I1\", \"KCNQ5\", \"HRH2\",\n    \"SLC12A5\", \"SAMD12\", \"SLC22A10\", \"GABRG3-AS1\", \"KCNIP4\", \"KCNJ6\", \"KCNK1\", \"KCNQ3\", \"GABRB3\", \"MICAL2\",\n    \"RIMBP2\", \"GABRA5\", \"KHDRBS2\", \"RGS7\", \"KIRREL3\", \"LINC01197\", \"MCTP1\", \"SNCA\", \"PRR16\", \"PTPRD\",\n    \"ABCA10\", \"CACNA2D3\", \"AC034268.2\", \"AC067956.1\", \"AC008574.1\", \"CAMK4\", \"ADGRL2\", \"YWHAH\", \"ATRNL1\", \"CACNA1E\",\n    \"AC007368.1\", \"UNC5D\", \"CBLN2\", \"AC027288.3\", \"ANKS1B\", \"ANKRD34C-AS1\", \"CCK\", \"CAMK2B\", \"FAM155A\", \"UCHL1\",\n    \"BICDL1\", \"SLC6A17\", \"AC109466.1\", \"FLRT2\", \"EPB41L3\", \"PTPRN\", \"BRINP1\", \"EPHA5\", \"EPHA3\", \"HPCA\",\n    \"SYT4\", \"MBP\", \"CA11\", \"SNCB\", \"EPHB6\", \"LINC01378\", \"AC124852.1\", \"RIMS2\", \"ANKRD30BL\", \"GRM1\",\n    \"GRIN2B\", \"TMEM130\", \"KCNH7\", \"ROBO2\", \"GNG3\", \"SHISA9\", \"RIT2\", \"AP000829.1\", \"LINC02263\", \"SLC24A2\",\n    \"ATP2B1\", \"RASAL1\", \"GABRA2\", \"TAFA2\", \"SLC38A11\", \"MIAT\", \"FRRS1L\", \"LINC01821\", \"EEF1A2\", \"SCN3B\"\n  ],\n  \"programs\": [\n    {\n      \"program_name\": \"Glutamatergic Synaptic Transmission\",\n      \"description\": \"Ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling, NMDA and AMPA receptor-mediated calcium influx, and presynaptic vesicular glutamate packaging.
