Through systematic literature review and functional annotation, approximately ten major gene programs have been identified that collectively encompass transcriptional regulation, cellular adhesion and migration, metabolic rewiring, signal transduction, and epigenetic control. These programs represent coordinated clusters of genes that work together to establish and maintain key features of astrocytoma pathophysiology, including oncogenic signaling, loss of growth constraints, altered differentiation states, and enhanced invasive capacity. The analysis reveals that while individual gene mutations drive initial transformation, the broader gene program landscape shapes the tumor's phenotypic manifestations, therapeutic vulnerabilities, and developmental context within reactive astrocyte activation.\n\n## Gene Programs in Transcriptional and Epigenetic Control\n\n### Program 1: AP-1 and Lineage-Specific Transcriptional Cascades in Reactive Transformation\n\nThe transcriptional reprogramming characteristic of astrocytoma initiation and progression involves coordinated activity of immediate-early genes, lineage-specific transcription factors, and chromatin remodeling complexes. Within the provided gene list, multiple transcription factors converge on this program, including ZEB1, TP63, BCL11A, and TAF3, which operate within broader networks that integrate injury signals and transformation drives. Research on reactive astrocytes reveals that following CNS injury or inflammatory stress, astrocytes undergo rapid transcriptional reconfiguration mediated through AP-1 binding sites that are then modulated by lineage-specific transcription factors[17]. In the context of astrocytoma, this injury-response program becomes dysregulated, with sustained or aberrant activation of these transcriptional networks driving pathological rather than reparative outcomes.\n\nZEB1, a zinc finger transcription factor present in the input gene list, represents a critical node in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasive phenotypes across multiple cancer types[27]. In astrocytoma, ZEB1 expression is associated with enhanced migratory capacity and reduced cell-cell adhesion through its repression of adherens junction components. The complementary gene ZEB1-AS1 (also present in the list) represents a long noncoding RNA that can modulate ZEB1 function, potentially through competing endogenous RNA mechanisms or through direct regulatory interactions. TP63, another member of the p53 family encoded in the input list, regulates stemness programs and can drive alternative differentiation pathways in neural progenitors[3]. While TP53 mutations are critical in astrocytoma pathogenesis, TP63 functions somewhat independently to regulate developmental programs relevant to progenitor populations from which astrocytomas may arise.\n\nBCL11A, a chromatin architectural transcription factor, contributes to cell identity specification and has been implicated in regulating developmental hemoglobin switching and neurodevelopmental processes[41]. In the neural context, BCL11A activity maintains progenitor cell populations and can influence the balance between proliferation and differentiation. The presence of both BCL11A and its complementary regulatory landscape suggests that astrocytomas may exploit developmental transcriptional programs normally silenced in mature astrocytes. TAF3, a TFIID-associated factor, participates in both general transcription initiation and selective activation of developmental genes[48], potentially bridging constitutive gene expression with stimulus-dependent transcriptional changes.\n\nImportantly, these transcription factors converge on reactive astrocyte gene programs identified through single-nucleus RNA sequencing studies, which reveal that injury-induced enhancers (IRENs) require both AP-1 and lineage-specific transcription factor binding for full activation[17]. The same regulatory logic appears operative in astrocytoma, where the tumor exploits developmental and injury-response transcriptional machinery to sustain proliferative and invasive programs. The zooming out to program-level implications reveals that dysregulation of transcriptional cascades enables astrocytomas to maintain progenitor-like transcriptional states while simultaneously activating pro-survival and anti-apoptotic programs.\n\n### Program 2: Histone Methylation and Chromatin Remodeling in Drug Tolerance and Transcriptional Plasticity\n\nRecent investigations into glioblastoma persisters—cells that survive chemotherapy through transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming—reveal that histone methyltransferases, particularly those depositing H3K4me3 (histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation) marks at promoters, play critical roles in enabling adaptive transcriptional responses[22]. While the provided gene list does not include comprehensive coverage of histone methyltransferases, the presence of PRDM9-regulated programs and the broader landscape of chromatin modification genes highlight the centrality of epigenetic plasticity in astrocytoma adaptation. PRDM9, though not directly in the input list, represents a methyltransferase whose activity is critical for establishing and maintaining H3K4me3 at specific genomic loci.\n\nHowever, within the input gene list, TAF3 contributes to transcriptional initiation complexes that interface with histone modifications. Furthermore, genes like SMYD3 (present in the provided list) encode histone methyltransferases that promote cancer cell proliferation through both direct histone modification and modulation of signaling pathways[24]. SMYD3-mediated histone methylation supports expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression and protein synthesis, particularly in cancer contexts. The functional implication for astrocytoma is that chromatin states established by SMYD3 activity may enable rapid transcriptional responses to metabolic stress or therapeutic challenge.\n\nThe program extending beyond single epigenetic modifiers involves integration of multiple chromatin-associated processes. Genes involved in nucleosome organization, chromatin accessibility, and transcription factor recruitment collectively establish the epigenetic landscape permissive for astrocytoma progression. The presence of multiple regulatory RNA genes in the list (LINC02391, LINC02397, LINC02821, and many others) suggests that long noncoding RNA-mediated chromatin remodeling may contribute to this program, though specific mechanisms remain understudied in astrocytoma.\n\n## Gene Programs in Cell-Cell Adhesion and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Plasticity\n\n### Program 3: Adherens Junctions and Cadherin-Mediated Adhesion\n\nCell-cell adhesion operates as a critical tumor suppressor mechanism in the nervous system, and its dysregulation represents a hallmark of astrocytoma progression and invasion. The provided gene list contains multiple components of adherens junction complexes and their regulators. PCDH15 and PCDH7 (protocadherins) represent non-classical cadherins with diverse functions in cell recognition and adhesion, particularly in neuronal contexts[26][28]. Protocadherins contribute to heterophilic cell-cell recognition and can enforce cell-type-specific sorting and alignment, functions that become dysregulated in astrocytoma to permit aberrant cell migration and invasion.\n\nPARD3, a core component of the Crumbs polarity complex that interfaces with adherens junctions and tight junctions, represents a critical architectural protein whose presence is necessary for proper epithelial organization[39][42]. In glioblastoma, PARD3 has been characterized as a polarity protein that simultaneously promotes self-renewal and suppresses invasiveness, suggesting that its loss or dysregulation permits increased motility[39]. The presence of both PARD3 and genes encoding its regulatory partners (such as VAV3, which activates Rac signaling downstream of PARD3) indicates that the program involves both junction assembly and dynamic regulation of junction stability.\n\nVAV3, a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), regulates cytoskeletal dynamics through activation of Rac and other Rho family GTPases. In the context of astrocytoma, VAV3 activity promotes cell motility by enabling rapid actin polymerization and focal adhesion remodeling. The coordinated presence of PARD3 and VAV3 suggests that astrocytomas may exploit programs where junction disruption (mediated through VAV3-Rac signaling) occurs concomitantly with dysregulation of polarity cues that would normally enforce adhesive phenotypes.\n\nFurther contributing to this program, ZEB1 (discussed above in the transcriptional regulation section) directly represses expression of adhesion molecules, including classical cadherins. The presence of ZEB1, its regulatory noncoding RNA (ZEB1-AS1), and direct components of the adherens junction machinery indicates a coherent program wherein transcriptional suppression of adhesive gene expression combines with altered junction dynamics and polarity signaling to enable invasive astrocytoma phenotypes.\n\n### Program 4: Extracellular Matrix Remodeling and Invasive Capacity\n\nAstrocytoma invasion requires enzymatic degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. Within the input gene list, MMP16 represents a membrane-anchored metalloproteinase implicated in matrix remodeling and tumor cell migration[21]. Matrix metalloproteinases collectively enable proteolytic breakdown of ECM components, facilitating infiltration of tumor cells into surrounding tissue. MMP16 specifically has been shown to promote cell invasiveness in multiple cancer contexts, and its expression is regulated by miR-146a, suggesting multiple layers of transcriptional and post-transcriptional control[23].\n\nComplementing the direct enzymatic activity of metalloproteases, the program includes genes that regulate matrix-cell interactions and mechanotransduction. Integrins and their associated signaling machinery (represented by genes contributing to focal adhesion complexes) translate ECM engagement into intracellular signals that promote migration. While classical integrin genes are not extensively represented in the provided list, genes like IGFBP2 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2) modulate growth factor signaling in the matrix microenvironment and have been specifically implicated in glioma progression through induction of M2 macrophage polarization[33].\n\nThe broader implication of the ECM remodeling program is that astrocytomas achieve invasion through coordinated suppression of adhesive constraints, activation of proteolytic machinery, and establishment of a permissive microenvironment that supports ongoing migration and infiltration. The presence of genes regulating both cell migration machinery and ECM composition indicates that the tumor is not merely passive in its interaction with surrounding tissue but actively sculpts the microenvironment to facilitate progression.\n\n## Gene Programs in Growth Factor Signaling and Metabolic Rewiring\n\n### Program 5: PDGFRA-Driven Proliferation and Gliomagenesis\n\nPlatelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRA) represents one of the most frequently altered genes in pediatric high-grade gliomas and certain astrocytoma subtypes. Within the mouse models of pediatric glioma, PDGFRA(D842V)—a constitutively active variant—drives rapid gliomagenesis and is sufficient as a primary oncogenic driver in multiple contexts, including when combined with Trp53 loss[1][15][18][58]. The presence of PDGFRA in the input gene list reflects its centrality to astrocytoma pathogenesis.\n\nPDGFRA signaling operates through receptor tyrosine kinase activation, leading to recruitment and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. These downstream effectors promote survival, proliferation, and metabolic rewiring. Multiple genes within the input list support this program: genes involved in MAPK signaling (MAP3K1, encoding a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase), and genes supporting metabolic adaptation including ME1 (malic enzyme 1), which catalyzes conversion of malate to pyruvate and is involved in both gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis, adaptive processes in tumor cells[32].\n\nThe functional significance of PDGFRA-driven programs is that astrocytomas maintain dependence on receptor tyrosine kinase signaling for sustained proliferation and survival. In mouse models, PDGFRA co-signaling with other alterations (such as NF1 loss) drives specific tumor subtypes characterized by distinct methylation profiles and genomic copy number alterations[1][15]. The program extends beyond PDGFRA itself to include downstream effectors and metabolic adaptations that sustain the proliferative state driven by ligand-independent receptor signaling.\n\n### Program 6: Lipid Metabolism and Membrane Remodeling in Cellular Plasticity\n\nEmerging evidence indicates that tumor cells, including glioblastomas and astrocytomas, undergo substantial lipid metabolic rewiring to support proliferation, membrane synthesis, and adaptation to metabolic stress. Within the input gene list, ELOVL2 (ELOVL fatty acid elongase 2) represents a key enzyme in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) synthesis[54], catalyzing the elongation of fatty acids with multiple unsaturated bonds. Recent work demonstrates that fatty acid elongase activity, particularly ELOVL-mediated synthesis of very long-chain PUFAs, can influence cellular phenotypes including ferroptosis susceptibility and metabolic adaptation[51].\n\nPDE3A, a phosphodiesterase involved in cAMP signaling, represents an additional component of metabolic regulation[47]. Cyclic nucleotide signaling and phosphodiesterase activity modulate multiple cellular processes including gene expression, metabolic flux, and cell motility. The presence of both lipid biosynthesis genes (ELOVL2) and signaling regulators (PDE3A) indicates that the program involves both direct metabolic changes and signal transduction adaptations.\n\nAdditionally, genes involved in lipid transport and organization (such as OSBPL10, an oxysterol-binding protein) represent specialized regulators of intracellular lipid distribution and vesicular trafficking. These genes collectively establish a program wherein astrocytoma cells actively remodel their lipid composition and signaling landscape to support tumor-specific phenotypes. Dysregulated lipid metabolism contributes to multiple tumorigenic processes: membrane synthesis for rapid cell division, generation of signaling lipids that activate growth pathways, and adaptation to metabolic stress through efficient energy storage and mobilization[51].\n\nThe program extends to ACSS3 (acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 3), which catalyzes conversion of acetate to acetyl-CoA, a critical entry point into lipid and cholesterol synthesis. Acetyl-CoA availability serves as a metabolic hub linking glucose and lipid metabolism, and its abundance can influence both epigenetic states (through histone acetylation) and biosynthetic programs. The presence of multiple lipid metabolic genes suggests that astrocytomas may maintain elevated rates of de novo lipogenesis, a metabolic hallmark of aggressive tumors.\n\n### Program 7: Nitric Oxide Signaling and Metabolic-Inflammatory Integration\n\nNOS2, encoding inducible nitric oxide synthase, represents a critical bridge between inflammatory signaling and metabolic regulation[10]. NOS2 catalyzes production of nitric oxide (NO), a reactive nitrogen species that mediates diverse cellular processes including vasodilation, immune regulation, and cell signaling. In the context of astrocytoma and gliomas more broadly, NOS2 expression is associated with inflammatory microenvironments and can influence both tumor cell behavior and immune cell infiltration.\n\nNitric oxide production by NOS2 can activate soluble guanylate cyclase, leading to increased cGMP and cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling. PDE3A, encoding a cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterase, participates in shaping the duration and magnitude of cyclic nucleotide signaling downstream of NO production. The coordinated presence of NOS2 and PDE3A suggests that nitric oxide signaling is actively regulated in astrocytoma, potentially enabling sustained inflammatory signaling that supports tumor growth while preventing excessive NO-mediated cytotoxicity.\n\nThe broader program encompasses the inflammatory and metabolic consequences of nitric oxide production. Enhanced NOS2 activity is characteristic of M1 macrophage and pro-inflammatory astrocyte activation states. In the tumor context, astrocytomas may exploit NOS2-dependent programs both intrinsically (through direct expression and NO-mediated signaling) and through shaping of the immune microenvironment. NO-dependent signaling can activate NF-κB pathways (represented by NFKB1 and RELB genes, though not in the current input list) and promote pro-inflammatory cytokine production by immune cells, creating an immunologically active but tumor-permissive microenvironment.\n\n## Gene Programs in Ion Channel Function and Cellular Excitability\n\n### Program 8: Ion Channel Organization and Calcium Signaling\n\nAstrocytes maintain specialized calcium signaling machinery that enables rapid communication with neurons and responds to extracellular signals. Multiple ion channels present in the input gene list contribute to this program, including KCNE4 (potassium channel regulatory subunit KCNE4), KCNJ16 (inward rectifier potassium channel), KCNIP1 (potassium channel-interacting protein), and TRPM3 (transient receptor potential cation channel M3)[53].\n\nTRPM3 represents a multimodal cation channel responsive to elevated temperature, steroids, and direct activation, contributing to calcium influx and cell signaling. TRPM3 activity influences cellular calcium dynamics, which can alter gene expression, cell migration, and metabolic state. In astrocytes, calcium signaling participates in neurovascular coupling, neuroimmune interactions, and metabolic support of neuronal activity. In astrocytoma, dysregulation of calcium signaling channels could contribute to altered cell migration, survival signaling, and interaction with the tumor microenvironment.\n\nKCNJ16 encodes an inward rectifier potassium channel that participates in setting resting membrane potential and potassium homeostasis. Altered potassium channel expression is associated with changes in cell migration and survival in cancer cells. The presence of multiple potassium channel regulatory genes (KCNE4, KCNJ16, KCNIP1) suggests that astrocytomas may alter their electrophysiological properties through dysregulated ion channel expression, potentially affecting migration capacity and metabolic state.\n\nCALM1 (calmodulin 1), though not explicitly in the input list but referenced in search results as related to TRPM3 function, represents a universal calcium-binding protein that participates in regulating calcium channel activity, including TRPM3[56]. The coordinated presence of multiple ion channel genes indicates that a program operates wherein astrocytomas establish altered calcium signaling capacity compared to normal astrocytes, potentially enabling enhanced migratory capacity, altered metabolic sensing, and modified neuroimmune interactions.\n\n### Program 9: Cyclic Nucleotide Signaling and Gene Expression Control\n\nComplementing the calcium signaling program, a distinct program operates through cyclic nucleotide metabolism and cAMP-responsive transcriptional control. CREM (cAMP responsive element modulator) and CREB1 (cAMP responsive element binding protein 1) represent transcription factors that respond to elevated cAMP levels and regulate expression of diverse target genes[45][48]. cAMP-responsive elements appear in the promoters of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, metabolic adaptation, and survival signaling.\n\nPDE3A, discussed above in the metabolic remodeling context, also participates in this program through its role in cAMP hydrolysis. Elevated PDE3A activity can suppress cAMP signaling, potentially reducing cAMP-dependent differentiation signals and permitting sustained proliferation. The presence of both CREM/CREB transcription factors and PDE3A suggests that cyclic nucleotide signaling is active in astrocytoma and subject to dynamic regulation.\n\nThe functional implication is that astrocytomas may exploit cyclic nucleotide signaling for adaptive responses to extracellular signals while simultaneously constraining these signals through elevated phosphodiesterase activity. This permits selective activation of survival and proliferation genes while suppressing differentiation programs that would normally limit tumor cell growth.\n\n## Gene Programs in Neural Development and Cell Identity\n\n### Program 10: Neuronal Interaction, Synaptogenesis, and Trans-Synaptic Signaling\n\nA substantial number of genes in the input list encode proteins traditionally characterized in the context of neuronal function and synaptic development. These include NRXN1 (neurexin 1), a presynaptic adhesion molecule[5]; JAG1 (jagged 1), a Notch ligand involved in neural development[11][14]; and multiple genes encoding neuropeptides and neuropeptide receptors. The presence of these genes in an astrocytoma gene list warrants careful interpretation, as astrocytomas are glial tumors but may derive from or maintain markers of neural developmental programs.\n\nNRXN1 and related neurexins form heterophilic adhesion complexes with neuroligins, functioning in synapse formation and stabilization. While NRXN1 is typically expressed by neurons, evidence suggests that astrocytes can express neurexins and participate in tripartite synapse-like interactions with neuronal synapses. In astrocytoma, the retention or dysregulation of NRXN1 expression may reflect a cell-of-origin population (potentially early glial progenitors with residual neuronal characteristics) or may represent selective advantages conferred through neuronal-like adhesion programs.\n\nJAG1 represents a Notch ligand with critical roles in neural development, specifically in regulating progenitor cell expansion and differentiation decisions. JAG1 expression by astrocytes participates in Notch signaling to endothelial cells, promoting angiogenic responses and vascular stabilization[14]. In astrocytoma, dysregulated JAG1 expression could contribute to enhanced angiogenesis (through direct endothelial Notch activation) and maintenance of progenitor-like transcriptional states (through autocrine or paracrine Notch signaling to tumor cells).\n\nThe broader program encompasses retention of developmental transcriptional networks normally silenced during terminal glial differentiation. This includes genes encoding neuropeptides and their receptors, which participate in neuron-glia signaling and neuroimmune interactions. The functional implication is that astrocytomas may partially recapitulate developmental neural programs, maintaining a state of incomplete glial maturation that permits sustained proliferation and enhanced interaction with the neuronal microenvironment.\n\n## Gene Programs in Cellular Cytoskeleton and Morphodynamics\n\n### Program 11: Actin Cytoskeleton Regulation and Cell Process Dynamics\n\nThe morphological complexity of astrocytes, with their elaborate process extensions that contact multiple neurons and blood vessels, depends on precise regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Multiple genes in the input list contribute to cytoskeletal dynamics, including SHROOM3 (shroom family actin regulatory protein 3), which promotes actin polymerization and influences cell shape[17]; VAV3 (discussed above as a Rac GEF); and genes involved in formin-mediated actin dynamics.\n\nSHROOM3 specifically promotes local actin polymerization through interaction with formin proteins, driving cell process extension and cell shape changes. In reactive astrocytes following injury, SHROOM3 activity supports the formation of hypertrophic processes that form the glial border and sequester inflammatory mediators. In astrocytoma, dysregulation of SHROOM3 could alter cellular morphology and affect capacity for process extension and cell-cell contact.\n\nFMN2 (formin family member 2) represents a formin protein that catalyzes actin polymerization through nucleation and elongation of linear actin filaments. Formin-mediated actin dynamics contribute to cell migration, process extension, and mechanotransduction. The presence of both SHROOM3 and genes regulating formin activity indicates that astrocytomas maintain active programs for cytoskeletal remodeling supporting migration and morphological plasticity.\n\nComplementing these positive regulators, genes involved in actin depolymerization and disassembly likely contribute to rapid cytoskeletal turnover enabling dynamic cell migration. The coordinated regulation of actin polymerization and depolymerization permits astrocytoma cells to rapidly remodel their morphology in response to environmental cues, facilitating invasion and adaptation to new microenvironments.\n\n## Gene Programs in Immune Regulation and Inflammatory Signaling\n\n### Program 12: Immune Cell Activation and Inflammatory Cytokine Signaling\n\nAstrocytomas do not develop in an immune vacuum but rather within a complex tumor microenvironment containing immune cells, particularly macrophages and microglia. Multiple genes in the input list interface with innate immune signaling, including genes encoding sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (represented by structure within the list), which participate in immune cell recognition and regulation.\n\nSYK (spleen tyrosine kinase) represents a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in immune receptor signaling, particularly in B cells and myeloid cells[34]. While SYK is not typically expressed by astrocytes in normal physiology, its presence in the input gene list might reflect altered immune cell populations within the astrocytoma microenvironment or potential misexpression by tumor cells that acquire immune-like signaling machinery.\n\nCD96 (CD96 molecule), present in the input list, represents an immune checkpoint receptor involved in T cell regulation. While classically expressed by T cells, expression by non-immune cells can modulate immune responses. The presence of immune-related genes in an astrocytoma gene list suggests that either the tumor cells themselves express immune regulatory molecules or that the input list reflects a tumor sample enriched for infiltrating immune cells, highlighting the immunological complexity of astrocytoma.\n\nThe broader program encompasses astrocytoma interaction with the immune microenvironment, including potential expression of immune checkpoint molecules, production of immunomodulatory cytokines (such as those generated through NOS2 signaling), and recruitment of infiltrating immune populations. Dysregulation of immune signaling can shift the balance toward immune tolerance, permitting tumor progression despite active immune infiltration.\n\n## Integration and Synthesis: Astrocytoma as a Disorder of Multiple Gene Programs\n\nThe analysis of individual gene programs reveals that astrocytoma does not represent a monolithic genetic disease but rather a disorder affecting multiple coordinated biological systems. The transcriptional and epigenetic control programs enable sustained activation of pro-growth genes while suppressing differentiation. Adhesion and migration programs collectively permit the loss of contact inhibition and enable invasion. Metabolic programs support the high biosynthetic demands of proliferation. Ion channel and signaling programs enable integration of environmental cues. Neural development programs maintain progenitor-like transcriptional states. Cytoskeletal programs provide the physical machinery for migration. Immune programs reshape the tumor microenvironment.\n\nCritically, these programs do not operate independently but rather intersect at multiple nodes. For example, PDGFRA signaling (Program 5) activates MAPK pathways that feed into both transcriptional control (Program 1) and metabolic rewiring (Program 6). Calcium signaling (Program 8) influences both gene expression and cytoskeletal dynamics (Program 11). Nitric oxide signaling (Program 7) participates in both metabolic adaptation and immune regulation (Program 12). This interconnected nature of gene programs suggests that therapeutic strategies targeting individual genes or pathways may be limited by compensatory activation of parallel programs. Conversely, understanding the integration points between programs may reveal nodes where multi-pathway inhibition could achieve more durable responses.\n\nThe presence of numerous long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) throughout the input gene list (LINC02391, LINC02397, LINC02821, LINC00355, LINC00528, LINC01185, LINC01241, LINC01446, LINC01505, LINC01508, LINC01828, LINC01876, LINC01923, and many others) points to an additional layer of regulatory complexity. LncRNAs can function as competing endogenous RNAs, chromatin modifiers, transcriptional regulators, and signal transducers. The specific mechanisms by which most of these lncRNAs contribute to astrocytoma pathogenesis remain understudied, but their consistent presence in multiple studies suggests widespread regulatory roles.\n\n## Contextual Interpretation: Normal Astrocyte Physiology versus Astrocytoma Pathology\n\nA critical framework for interpreting these gene programs involves understanding how they relate to normal astrocyte function and how dysregulation of normally adaptive programs drives transformation. Reactive astrocytes, activated by CNS injury or inflammation, undergo the very transcriptional and morphological changes that astrocytomas exploit: extension of hypertrophic processes (Program 11), activation of inflammatory signaling (Program 12), and remodeling of metabolic capacity (Program 6). The distinction between reactive astrocytes and astrocytoma lies not in the activation of individual programs but in the persistence, magnitude, and dysregulation of these programs combined with additional oncogenic alterations.\n\nIn normal physiology, reactive astrocyte activation is reversible and context-dependent, ceasing when the inciting insult resolves. In contrast, astrocytoma programs become constitutively active and refractory to normal regulatory signals. Oncogenic alterations, such as PDGFRA activation (Program 5) and TP53 loss, drive sustained activation of these programs. The transcriptional and epigenetic programs (Programs 1 and 2) become locked into tumor-permissive states through both genetic alterations and epigenetic modifications.\n\nThe developmental context is particularly important for understanding astrocytoma biology. Many of the gene programs represented in the list reflect either embryonic neural development (retention of JAG1, neuronal markers suggesting origin from early progenitor populations) or adult reactive states. This suggests that astrocytomas may derive from or maintain characteristics of developmental progenitor populations that retain multipotency and are more readily transformed by oncogenic alterations. Alternatively, astrocytomas may represent a failure of normal glial differentiation, wherein cells arrested at progenitor stages accumulate oncogenic alterations while maintaining developmental transcriptional programs.\n\n## Evidence Gap Analysis and Context-Dependent Interpretations\n\nSeveral important caveats warrant explicit acknowledgment. The provided gene list totals approximately 150 genes, yet systematic characterization of all genes in astrocytoma contexts is incomplete. For many genes, functional data exist in non-astrocytoma contexts (particularly in model systems such as lymphocyte development, cardiac physiology, or sensory biology), and direct astrocytoma-relevant data may be limited. The analysis presented above prioritizes genes with established roles in glial biology, central nervous system development, or cancer pathogenesis, but includes multiple genes whose astrocytoma-specific functions require future characterization.\n\nThe search results provided, while containing relevant information about astrocyte biology, pediatric glioma models, and reactive astrocyte responses, are limited in directly addressing the entire input gene list. The analysis therefore relies on functional annotations from broader cancer biology, neural development, and cell biology literature, integrated with the specific context of astrocytoma. This approach identifies plausible functional roles but recognizes that definitive validation requires experimental characterization within astrocytoma-specific systems.\n\n---\n\n# Comprehensive Gene Programs in Astrocytoma: JSON Encoding\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"cell_type\": \"astrocytes, glial progenitor cells\",\n    \"disease\": \"astrocytoma (including high-grade gliomas with astrocytic differentiation)\",\n    \"tissue\": \"central nervous system (CNS), brain\"\n  },\n  \"input_genes\": [\n    \"ABCB5\", \"MOXD1\", \"LINC02391\", \"LINC02397\", \"LINC02821\", \"LRP4\", \"MACORIS\", \"MALRD1\", \"MAP3K1\", \"ME1\", \"MIR217HG\", \"MMP16\", \"MPPED2\", \"AC006206.2\", \"NAV2\", \"NCALD\", \"NOS2\", \"NPNT\", \"NPSR1-AS1\", \"NRIP1\", \"NRXN1\", \"OSBPL10\", \"PAPOLG\", \"PARD3\", \"LINC02378\", \"LINC02058\", \"LINC02008\", \"LINC01965\", \"IL1RAPL2\", \"JAG1\", \"KCNE4\", \"KCNIP1\", \"KCNJ16\", \"KIAA1217\", \"KLHDC8A\", \"KLRC2\", \"LDLRAD3\", \"LHFPL3\", \"LHFPL3-AS1\", \"LINC00355\", \"LINC00528\", \"LINC01185\", \"LINC01241\", \"LINC01446\", \"LINC01505\", \"LINC01508\", \"LINC01828\", \"LINC01876\", \"LINC01923\", \"PCBP3\", \"PCDH15\", \"PCDH7\", \"SORCS1\", \"SPATA6\", \"SPRY4\", \"ST6GALNAC5\", \"STS\", \"SYK\", \"TAF3\", \"TENM1\", \"TMEM176B\", \"TMEM72-AS1\", \"TP63\", \"TPRG1\", \"TRPM3\", \"USH1C\", \"USP6NL\", \"VAV3\", \"VSTM4\", \"WNK2\", \"ZEB1\", \"ZEB1-AS1\", \"ZFHX4\", \"ZFHX4-AS1\", \"SOX5\", \"SMYD3\", \"PCSK2\", \"SLCO2A1\", \"PDE3A\", \"PDGFRA\", \"PELI1\", \"PEX13\", \"PIP4K2A\", \"PKIA-AS1\", \"PRTFDC1\", \"PTPRZ1\", \"PUS10\", \"RAPGEF5\", \"REL\", \"RIT2\", \"RNF220\", \"ROBO2\", \"RPH3A\", \"RSU1\", \"RYR3\", \"SESN3\", \"SHROOM3\", \"SIPA1L2\", \"SLCO1A2\", \"IGFBP2\", \"HIVEP3\", \"HIP1\", \"AC092957.1\", \"AC093912.1\", \"AC113167.1\", \"AC129807.1\", \"AC233296.1\", \"ACSS3\", \"ADAMTS6\", \"AF130359.1\", \"AF279873.3\", \"AGMO\", \"AL050309.1\", \"AL096854.1\", \"AL117329.1\", \"AL136171.2\", \"AL139231.1\", \"AL157778.1\", \"AL157944.1\", \"AL353613.1\", \"AL353753.1\", \"AL606923.2\", \"AP000787.1\", \"AP001924.1\", \"AC093515.1\", \"AC092155.1\", \"ARHGAP12\", \"AC090993.1\", \"AC007098.1\", \"AC007100.1\", \"AC007344.1\", \"AC007402.1\", \"AC008554.1\", \"AC009501.3\", \"AC010991.1\", \"AC011246.1\", \"AC011287.1\", \"AC011306.1\", \"AC012368.1\", \"AC013287.1\", \"AC016727.1\", \"AC018462.1\", \"AC060834.2\", \"AC068308.1\", \"AC073365.1\", \"AC079304.1\", \"AC087855.2\", \"AC090630.1\", \"AC090692.1\", \"AP001977.1\", \"ARHGEF28\", \"GRIA3\", \"DGKB\", \"DLL3\", \"DNAJC1\", \"DPF3\", \"DUXAP8\", \"EHBP1\", \"ELOVL2\", \"ENKUR\", \"EPHA3\", \"EYA1\", \"FABP5\", \"FAM107B\", \"FAM161A\", \"FAT3\", \"FHIT\", \"FMN2\", \"GABRA4\", \"GABRB1\", \"GABRE\", \"GALNT2\", \"GNGT1\", \"GPR158\", \"DISC1\", \"DENND2A\", \"ASB4\", \"CSPG5\", \"BCL11A\", \"BEND7\", \"BEST3\", \"BNC2\", \"C2ORF74\", \"CACNB2\", \"CASC9\", \"CCDC7\", \"CCN4\", \"CD96\", \"CELF2\", \"CFAP47\", \"CHL1\", \"CLVS2\", \"COL28A1\", \"COLGALT2\", \"CPNE4\", \"CPPED1\", \"CPVL\", \"CREM\", \"CSMD1\", \"ZNF438\"\n  ],\n  \"programs\": [\n    {\n      \"program_name\": \"AP-1 and Lineage-Specific Transcriptional Cascades\",\n      \"description\": \"Dysregulated transcriptional reprogramming mediated through AP-1 binding sites modulated by lineage-specific transcription factors (ZEB1, TP63, BCL11A, TAF3) that drive transformation of normal reactive astrocyte gene expression into constitutive pathogenic programs.

Therapeutic strategies targeting individual pathways or single genes may face resistance through compensatory activation of parallel programs. Conversely, understanding the intersection points between programs—such as how PDGFRA signaling feeds into transcriptional control, metabolic adaptation, and cytoskeletal remodeling—identifies nodes where multi-pathway inhibition could achieve more durable therapeutic responses. The presence of numerous long noncoding RNAs throughout the gene list points to an additional regulatory layer whose roles in astrocytoma pathogenesis require systematic future characterization.\n\nFurthermore, the analysis emphasizes the critical importance of context—astrocytoma programs represent dysregulations of normal astrocyte physiology and developmental programs. Understanding how reactive astrocyte responses to injury become pathologically sustained in transformation, and how developmental progenitor programs become reactivated in otherwise differentiated cells, provides mechanistic insight into tumor biology and identifies potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. The integration of functional genomics with cell biology, developmental neurobiology, and immunology will be essential for translating this gene program analysis into effective therapeutic strategies addressing the multifaceted pathobiology of astrocytoma.",

SHROOM3 promotes actin polymerization through interactions with formin proteins like FMN2, driving cell process extension. VAV3, functioning as a Rac GEF, activates Rac GTPases that promote cytoskeletal remodeling. In reactive astrocytes following CNS injury, these same programs drive hypertrophic morphology enabling formation of glial borders and sequestration of inflammatory mediators. In astrocytoma, dysregulation of these programs enables rapid morphological remodeling, enhanced migration, and altered interaction with the tumor microenvironment. The coordinated presence of multiple actin regulatory genes indicates that astrocytomas maintain active programs for cytoskeletal remodeling supporting diverse phenotypes including migratory, proliferative, and pro-inflammatory states.",

The presence of NRXN1 in astrocytoma suggests either that tumors derive from or maintain characteristics of early neural progenitor populations with incomplete glial differentiation, or that astrocytomas selectively reactivate neuronal developmental programs. Similarly, JAG1, a Notch ligand critical for neural development and progenitor cell expansion, is expressed by normal astrocytes where it participates in endothelial Notch signaling promoting vascular interactions, but dysregulation in astrocytoma could enhance both angiogenesis and autocrine Notch signaling maintaining progenitor-like transcriptional states. The coordinated presence of these developmental markers suggests that astrocytomas partially recapitulate developmental neural programs, maintaining a state of incomplete maturation that permits sustained proliferation and enhanced interaction with the neuronal and vascular microenvironment.",
