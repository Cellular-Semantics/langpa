This program encompasses transcriptional control through inhibitors of DNA binding (ID3, ID4) and involves aquaporin-4 (AQP4) for water homeostasis and process dynamics. Reactive astrocytes upregulate GFAP and extend hypertrophic, arborized processes forming glial barriers that insulate injury sites and disease lesions from healthy tissue, representing a coordinated transcriptional reprogramming that both maintains astrocyte identity and drives the transformation from resting to reactive state.",

In traumatic brain injury models, astrocyte activation persists for extended periods with sustained GFAP and VIM expression even one year post-injury, suggesting that reactive states become entrenched and difficult to resolve. The transcriptional regulators ID3 and ID4 control whether astrocytes remain proliferative or undergo terminal differentiation, with dysregulation potentially promoting malignant transformation. AQP4 and AQP4-AS1 coordinate astrocyte water homeostasis, a process essential for maintaining osmotic balance during process extension and retraction. In astrocytoma, this program likely establishes and maintains a reactive astrocyte identity while simultaneously preventing differentiation and promoting proliferation through dysregulated ID protein signaling.",

Recent work demonstrates that dysregulation of microRNA-33 increases in AD patients and animal models, with miR-33 dysregulation impairing ABCA1 expression and thereby reducing cholesterol efflux capacity. CRISPR-mediated targeting of miR-33 in astrocytes restores ApoE lipidation and ameliorates amyloid-beta burden both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that lipid metabolism dysregulation directly contributes to neurodegeneration.

TRIM24::NTRK2 fusion shows highest activation in PI3K pathway signaling and MAPK/PI3K downstream effector pS6, suggesting robust oncogenic signaling. Axon guidance molecules including RGMA and SEMA6A function in restricting axon growth, with dysregulation in astrocytoma potentially contributing to aberrant network organization within peritumoral regions. NRG3 participates in ErbB receptor signaling supporting neuronal development and myelination, with dysregulation likely impairing normal supportive functions.",

CDH11, encoding cadherin-11, mediates homophilic adhesion particularly in neural tissues where it supports synaptic organization and astrocyte-neuron interactions. PARD3 and PARD3B encode core components of the PAR (partitioning defective) polarity complex, which establishes cell polarity through asymmetric protein distribution. Recent work reveals striking decline in PAR complex protein expression during malignant transformation, with polarity disruption emerging as an early central molecular event in tumorigenesis and oral squamous cell carcinoma. This suggests that dysregulation of PARD3/PARD3B may similarly drive astrocytoma development and progression by relieving polarity constraints. GJA1 encodes connexin-43, which forms gap junctions enabling direct communication between astrocytes through passage of small molecules and ions. Dysregulation of gap junction function in astrocytoma likely disrupts coordinated astrocyte responses and impairs communication between tumor astrocytes and surrounding tissue.

Astrocytes produce IL-33 in response to injury, with elevated IL-33 in chronic-phase astrocytes suggesting neuroprotective polarization. CD44 serves as hyaluronic acid receptor functioning in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions while supporting inflammatory signaling and immune cell recruitment. CD44 shows particularly high expression in cancer stem cells and tumor-promoting macrophages, suggesting roles in both tumor cell biology and immune cell polarization. MASP1 encodes mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-1 participating in complement pathway activation, critical for innate immunity. IFI44L encodes interferon-induced protein 44-like functioning downstream of interferon signaling, with comprehensive enrichment of interferon-α and interferon-γ response pathways observed in reactive astrocytes across injury models. In astrocytoma, dysregulation of inflammatory signaling likely reflects complex interactions between tumor-promoting pro-inflammatory and immune-suppressive signaling.",
