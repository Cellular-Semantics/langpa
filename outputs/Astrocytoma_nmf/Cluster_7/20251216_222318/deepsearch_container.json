The 170 genes provided constitute a substantial molecular signature with potential relevance to multiple aspects of astrocytoma pathogenesis, including transformation, invasion, metabolic reprogramming, and interactions with the tumor microenvironment. This report presents a systematic analysis of these genes as functional programs—coordinated gene clusters operating within specific biological pathways and cellular processes—anchored in the established literature on astrocyte physiology and astrocytoma oncobiology. Through integrative analysis of gene interactions, regulatory networks, and pathway dynamics, we identify eleven major gene programs spanning cell adhesion and invasion, kinase signaling, metabolic reprogramming, synaptic dysfunction, and transcriptional control. Each program is evaluated for its potential contribution to tumor progression while considering both the cell-autonomous properties of neoplastic astrocytes and their interactions with the broader tumor microenvironment.\n\n## Integrin-Mediated Cell Adhesion and Mechanotransduction Program\n\nThe adhesion and mechanotransduction program emerges as a central hub coordinating cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix and neighboring cells. This program encompasses integrin heterodimers, focal adhesion scaffolds, and downstream signaling cascades that transduce mechanical cues into biochemical signals. Within the input gene list, the program includes integrin alpha subunits (ITGA3, ITGA7), integrin beta-8 (ITGB8), and multiple structural proteins that mediate cell-matrix interactions. Notably, talin force coupling represents a critical molecular mechanism by which integrins activate in response to mechanical tension, requiring the coordinated function of integrin cytoplasmic tails, talin head domains, and downstream actin-binding proteins[56]. The presence of LIMK1 and ARHGAP26 in the input list suggests that Rho-family GTPases, which regulate actin dynamics through their effectors, likely contribute to mechanotransduction in these astrocytoma cells. \n\nIntegrin-mediated signaling has been directly implicated in glioma cell migration and invasion, two hallmark features of malignant astrocytomas. ITGA3 and ITGA7, encoding alpha-3 and alpha-7 integrin subunits respectively, participate in heterodimeric complex formation with beta-1 integrins to engage collagen and laminin in the extracellular matrix. The laminin-binding integrins present in astrocytomas would support adhesion to basement membranes during invasion of the brain parenchyma and blood vessels. ITGB8, an integrin beta subunit with more restricted expression patterns, associates with alpha-V to form a receptor for fibronectin and other ligands; its presence in this gene list suggests active matrix remodeling and cellular migration phenotypes. Mechanotransduction through these adhesion receptors activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phosphorylates paxillin at critical tyrosine residues, and promotes the nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ transcriptional co-activators—a cascade that is often dysregulated in cancer[56]. While FAK itself does not appear in the input list, multiple downstream effectors do, suggesting that integrin signaling may be partially uncoupled from canonical FAK activation in these cells.\n\nThe adhesion program also includes extracellular matrix proteins that serve as ligands and modulators of integrin signaling. POSTN (periostin), a matricellular protein, was recently shown to promote sarcoma growth and metastasis by recruiting tumor-associated macrophages and suppressing anti-tumor immune responses[30]. In astrocytomas, periostin is often upregulated in the tumor stroma and tumor cells themselves, promoting a pro-tumoral microenvironment through non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. LAMC1 and LAMA2 encode laminin gamma-1 and alpha-2 chains, major components of basement membrane and extracellular matrix that serve as scaffolds for cell migration and differentiation. Collectively, this program is predicted to enhance focal adhesion assembly, promote mechanically regulated gene expression through YAP/TAZ signaling, and facilitate invasion through ECM remodeling, all processes central to astrocytoma progression.\n\n## Rho GTPase Signaling and Cytoskeletal Organization Program\n\nRho-family GTPases represent critical intracellular switches controlling actin dynamics, cell migration, and invasion. The input gene list contains multiple regulators of Rho GTPase signaling that collectively form a sophisticated program for controlling RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 activities. This program includes guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as ARHGEF26 and TRIO, which catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP to activate these proteins; GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) such as DLC1, ARHGAP26, and SIPA1L1, which inactivate GTPases by promoting GTP hydrolysis; and negative feedback regulators such as VAV3, which itself acts as a GEF for Rac1 and Cdc42 in response to receptor signaling. Previous studies have demonstrated that DLC1 SAM domain-binding peptides inhibit cancer cell growth and migration by inactivating RhoA[12], suggesting that dysregulation of DLC1 in astrocytomas may contribute to uncontrolled cell motility.\n\nRHOJ, encoding a GTPase family member, is present in the list and may contribute to Rho-dependent contractility and migration. The Rho-ROCK pathway, where ROCK1 serves as a key effector, promotes the formation of stress fibers and cell contractility necessary for invasion. While ROCK1 itself is not in the input list, the presence of multiple Rho pathway regulators (RGS6, RGS17, SPRY2, SPRY4, SPRED1, SPRED2) indicates robust negative feedback on growth factor signaling that converges on Rho activation. RGS (Regulator of G-protein Signaling) proteins inhibit heterotrimeric G-protein signaling and often indirectly suppress Rho-GEF activation, thus dampening Rho signaling. Sprouty and Spred proteins are well-characterized negative feedback regulators of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways, including the MAPK/ERK cascade, suggesting a brake on growth factor-driven proliferation and migration.\n\nThe cytoskeletal program operates in concert with the adhesion program to control cell shape, migratory velocity, and invasive capacity. Genes encoding actin-binding proteins and their regulators—such as SHROOM3 (a regulator of apical-basal polarity that influences cell migration), TRIM9 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase affecting cytoskeletal dynamics), and LIMK1 (a kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates cofilin to stabilize actin filaments)—collectively enable the dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton required for migration. In astrocytomas, enhanced Rho signaling combined with weakened negative feedback (through loss or downregulation of GAPs and RGS proteins) would promote excessive actin polymerization, stress fiber formation, and cell migration. Conversely, dysregulation of these brakes could lead to uncontrolled migration.\n\n## Kinase Signaling Cascades and Cell Proliferation Program\n\nThe proliferation program encompasses a diverse set of kinases that control cell cycle progression, survival signaling, and growth factor responses. This program includes cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK6, CDK14), Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CAMK2B, CAMK2D), serine-threonine kinases (STK17A, STK32A, STK32B, NEK6), the neuron-specific tyrosine kinase SYN (FYN is listed), and the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a receptor tyrosine kinase frequently dysregulated in various malignancies. CDK6 is particularly relevant to astrocytomas, as it drives G1-to-S phase transition and is often overexpressed in high-grade gliomas through amplification of the chromosome 7q locus where CDK6 resides. ALK, when dysregulated through fusion events or amplification, contributes to constitutive kinase signaling that drives proliferation and transformation[17][19].\n\nMAP3K1, encoding a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase, sits upstream of MAPK/ERK and JNK signaling cascades that control proliferation, differentiation, and stress responses. The presence of PREX1, a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent Rac exchange factor, suggests that the PI3K/Akt pathway, a major survival and proliferation pathway often activated in astrocytomas through PIK3CA mutations or PTEN loss, contributes to this program. CAMK2B and CAMK2D, which are calcium-dependent protein kinases, may link calcium signaling (a prominent feature of astrocyte physiology) to proliferation and migration. The CAMK pathway is activated downstream of NMDA-type glutamate receptors and is essential for neuronal plasticity; in astrocytomas that dysregulate glutamate handling, CAMK signaling may become inappropriately activated to promote proliferation[42].\n\nWhile the input list includes negative regulators of growth signaling (RGS, Sprouty, and Spred proteins as noted above), the net balance in astrocytoma cells is predicted to favor proliferation, as oncogenic kinase signaling often overcomes negative feedback. This program is expected to drive enhanced cell cycle progression, reduced apoptosis, and prolonged survival of neoplastic astrocytes.\n\n## MAPK/ERK Pathway Regulation Through Feedback Control Program\n\nClosely related to but distinct from the broader kinase signaling program is a specialized regulatory network controlling MAPK/ERK signaling through negative feedback loops. The input list contains multiple negative regulators of this pathway: SPRY2, SPRY4, SPRED1, SPRED2, and DUSP6. These genes encode proteins that collectively suppress MAPK/ERK signaling at multiple levels. Sprouty proteins inhibit RTK signaling through multiple mechanisms, including sequestration of Grb2 adaptor proteins and inhibition of Ras activation. Spred proteins similarly suppress Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling. DUSP6, a member of the dual-specificity phosphatase family, directly dephosphorylates and inactivates ERK1/2, providing rapid feedback suppression. \n\nIn normal astrocytes, these feedback mechanisms maintain tight control over MAPK signaling in response to growth factors and cytokines. In astrocytomas, dysregulation of these suppressors—either through loss of expression, mutation, or epigenetic silencing—combined with activation of upstream kinases (through RAS or BRAF mutations, or receptor tyrosine kinase amplification) creates a permissive environment for sustained MAPK/ERK signaling. Conversely, the presence of these negative regulators in the input gene list might suggest either that their suppression is a key event in transformation, or that their residual activity constrains proliferation in certain astrocytoma subtypes. The transcriptional output of MAPK/ERK signaling includes proliferation genes, EMT-related factors, and pro-survival signals, all relevant to astrocytoma progression.\n\n## Calcium Signaling and Neuronal-Astrocyte Interaction Program\n\nCalcium signaling represents a fundamental mechanism by which astrocytes integrate extracellular and intracellular cues and communicate with neurons. The input gene list contains multiple components of the calcium signaling machinery, including ion channels (TRPM3, GRIN2B, GRIA3, KCNMA1, KCND2) and calcium-handling proteins (ITPR2, RYR3, CAMK2B, CAMK2D). ITPR2, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 2, is a calcium channel in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that couples phospholipase C signaling to calcium release from intracellular stores. Recent work has demonstrated that ITPR2-mediated calcium release is critical for mitochondrial calcium uptake and the promotion of cellular senescence in response to various stress signals[21][22]. In astrocytomas, dysregulation of ITPR2 could alter calcium homeostasis, promote mitochondrial dysfunction, and either suppress or enhance senescence depending on context.\n\nGRIN2B and GRIA3 encode NMDA and AMPA-type glutamate receptors, respectively. While these are classically viewed as neuronal receptors, emerging evidence indicates that astrocytes express functional glutamate receptors that mediate their responses to synaptic glutamate. In astrocytomas growing in the brain, the tumor cells are surrounded by neurons and synaptic terminals; aberrant expression of glutamate receptors in tumor astrocytes could enable inappropriate calcium signaling in response to synaptic activity or ectopic glutamate release by the tumor itself[42]. KCNMA1 and KCND2 encode voltage-gated potassium channels (large-conductance and fast inactivating A-type channels, respectively) that regulate cellular excitability. Astrocytes primarily express different potassium channels (including inward rectifiers), but their dysregulation in astrocytomas could affect calcium buffering and cell migration.\n\nCHRM3 and P2RY14 encode G-protein-coupled receptors (a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and a purinergic receptor, respectively) that trigger intracellular calcium release through Gq-coupled signaling cascades[2]. In astrocytes, these receptors are activated by synaptic transmitters (acetylcholine, ATP) and initiate calcium waves that propagate through gap junctions and trigger the release of gliotransmitters. In astrocytomas, dysregulation of these receptors could drive calcium-dependent proliferation, migration, or crosstalk with the neural microenvironment. Importantly, recent evidence has revealed that astrocytic mitochondrial connexin-43 (Cx43), while not directly in this list, regulates IDH3α to maintain glycolytic metabolism and lactate production essential for neuronal excitability in normal brain[43]. Dysregulation of mitochondrial calcium handling and metabolism could alter this astrocyte-neuron coupling and promote tumor growth.\n\n## Synaptic Organization and Neuron-Tumor Interaction Program\n\nA substantial subset of the input gene list encodes proteins classically associated with synaptic function, neuronal development, and neuron-astrocyte interactions. These include growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), synaptojanin-2 (SYNJ2), kinesin light chain proteins (implied through KANK1), neuronal cell adhesion molecules (NRCAM, CHL1, LSAMP), and glutamate receptors (GRIA3, GRIN2B, GRIK2). GAP43, also known as neuromodulin, is a well-characterized marker of axonal regeneration and growth cone development; its expression in astrocytomas is thought to reflect a permissive microenvironment for neuronal growth or aberrant neural-like differentiation[47]. NRCAM (neuronal cell adhesion molecule) mediates axon-axon and axon-glia interactions, and its expression in astrocytomas could facilitate physical interactions between tumor cells and neurons[39].\n\nThe presence of genes encoding synaptic proteins in astrocytomas is striking and suggests either that these tumors retain a program of neural development or interaction, or that they actively upregulate synaptic genes to manipulate the neuronal microenvironment. Recent work has demonstrated that tumor-derived glutamate, acting through neuronal NMDA and AMPA receptors, drives aberrant neuronal excitability and promotes seizures in peritumoral cortex[42]. The presence of glutamate receptor subunits and associated signaling proteins in astrocytomas suggests that tumors may also directly participate in glutamate signaling. Additionally, synaptogenic factors produced by specific astrocyte populations have been linked to tumor-associated seizures, implicating dysregulated astrocyte-neuron interactions as a key feature of high-grade glioma pathobiology[42].\n\nCREB5, a cAMP response element-binding protein, is a transcription factor that integrates calcium and cAMP signaling to control gene expression. In astrocytes, CREB phosphorylation downstream of calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels or NMDA receptors drives the expression of neuroprotective and growth-promoting genes. In astrocytomas, dysregulation of CREB5 could shift the balance between pro-tumoral and anti-tumoral programs. The combined dysregulation of calcium signaling, synaptic machinery, and CREB-dependent transcription in astrocytomas likely explains their unique capacity to interact extensively with neurons and promote peritumoral neuronal dysfunction.\n\n## Transcriptional Regulation and Cellular Differentiation Program\n\nAstrocytes undergo progressive differentiation during brain development, transitioning from neural progenitors to mature astrocytes with characteristic morphology, gene expression, and functional properties. The input gene list contains multiple transcription factors implicated in astrocyte differentiation and identity: SATB2 (special AT-rich sequence binding protein 2), LEF1 (lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1), RUNX1 (runt-related transcription factor 1), CREB5, LMO2 (LIM domain only 2), MEIS1 (meis homeobox 1), HMGA2 (high-mobility group AT-hook 2), NPAS3 (neuronal PAS domain protein 3), and ENC1 (ectodermal-neural cortex 1).\n\nSATB2 is a matrix attachment region-binding protein that functions as a potent transcription factor promoting osteoblastogenesis and bone regeneration[23][26]. In the nervous system, SATB2 is involved in axonal outgrowth and connectivity. LEF1 is a key component of Wnt signaling and is required for neural progenitor maintenance and fate decisions. RUNX1 is essential for hematopoietic differentiation but is also expressed in neural tissues where it influences developmental programs. MEIS1 and LMO2 function as cofactors for HOXA cluster genes, which establish developmental hierarchies during hematopoiesis and likely contribute to neural patterning as well[24][27]. HMGA2 is a high-mobility group protein that functions as a architectural transcription factor and is frequently upregulated in cancers through amplification or t(12;15) translocations, where it drives undifferentiated and stem-like phenotypes.\n\nIn astrocytomas, dysregulation of this transcriptional program is expected to maintain cells in a more progenitor-like or dedifferentiated state, preventing terminal astrocytic differentiation and preserving proliferative capacity. High-grade astrocytomas often display reduced expression of mature astrocytic markers (GFAP, glutamine synthetase) and elevated expression of progenitor markers (nestin, Sox2, Olig2), consistent with a dedifferentiation or block in differentiation. The input list suggests that transcriptional regulators controlling neural progenitor identity and developmental processes are dysregulated in ways that promote stemness and self-renewal in neoplastic astrocytes.\n\n## Extracellular Matrix Remodeling and Invasion Program\n\nThe invasion program encompasses genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins, matrix-degrading proteases, and their regulators. This includes ADAMTS9 and ADAMTS9-AS1 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 9 and its long non-coding RNA), ADAM19 and ADAM12 (ADAM domain proteases with substrate specificity for different ECM components), and MMP14 (matrix metallopeptidase 14, also known as MT1-MMP), a membrane-anchored protease critical for ECM remodeling during invasion[31]. ADAMTS proteases cleave aggrecan, versican, and other ECM components, while ADAM proteases participate in shedding of cell surface proteins and ECM remodeling. MMP14 operates at the interface between tumor cells and the ECM, creating local zones of ECM degradation that enable cell invasion.\n\nPOSTN (periostin) functions as a matricellular protein—a category of secreted proteins that regulate cell-ECM interactions without providing primary structural support. Periostin promotes invasion, metastasis, and immune suppression in multiple cancer types through non-cell-autonomous mechanisms involving immune cell recruitment and reprogramming[30][32]. The presence of both ECM components (LAMC1, LAMA2, LAMA4, COL4A2, COL22A1, FBN2) and remodeling enzymes (ADAMTS9, ADAM19, ADAM12, MMP14) in the input list suggests an active program of ECM remodeling in these astrocytomas, with implications for invasion, migration, and immune cell infiltration. SRPX (sushi repeat-containing protein X), a secreted protein, and FRMD5 (FERM domain-containing 5), a cytoplasmic scaffolding protein, may contribute to the coordination of cell-ECM interactions during migration.\n\n## Metabolic Reprogramming Program\n\nAstrocytomas, like most cancers, undergo profound metabolic rewiring to support rapid growth while adapting to the hypoxic and glucose-rich brain environment. The input list contains multiple metabolic genes: BCAT1 (branched-chain amino acid transaminase 1), GLDC (glycine cleavage system protein H), ACSBG1 (acyl-CoA synthetase butyrate-CoA ligase 1), ACSS3 (acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 3), ELOVL2 (ELOVL fatty acid elongase 2), OSBP2 (oxysterol binding protein 2), and VMP1 (vacuole membrane protein 1). BCAT1 catalyzes the transamination of branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, valine) to branched-chain alpha-ketoacids, linking amino acid and energy metabolism. GLDC encodes a component of the glycine cleavage system, which converts glycine to CO2, ammonia, and a one-carbon unit; dysregulation of this pathway has been implicated in various malignancies.\n\nACSBG1 and ACSS3 activate short- and medium-chain fatty acids for entry into lipid synthesis and energy metabolism pathways. ELOVL2 elongates polyunsaturated fatty acids, a process important for membrane biogenesis and signaling lipid synthesis. Metabolic alterations in astrocytomas include shift toward aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect), enhanced glutamine utilization (glutaminolysis), and increased lipid synthesis to support rapid membrane production for cell growth and division. The astrocytoma metabolic program is predicted to enhance glucose and glutamine uptake, promote aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction, and increase biosynthetic precursor generation for cell growth.\n\n## Migration and Guidance Program\n\nCellular migration requires coordinated regulation of adhesion, cytoskeletal dynamics, and directional cue sensing. The input list contains genes encoding guidance cues (SEMA5A, SEMA3A, SEMA3E) and their receptors, as well as migration-associated kinases and scaffolding proteins. SEMA5A, SEMA3A, and SEMA3E are semaphorins, secreted or membrane-bound signaling proteins that were originally discovered as axon guidance cues but are now recognized as critical regulators of cell migration in multiple contexts. Semaphorins interact with plexin and neuropilin receptors to trigger repulsion or attraction. In gliomas, semaphorins can drive or suppress invasion depending on the specific semaphorin-receptor pair and cellular context.\n\nETV5 and ETV6, encoding ETS transcription factors, regulate target genes in response to MAPK/ERK signaling and participate in both normal development and oncogenic transformation. Notably, EML4-ALK fusion proteins, which are frequent in non-small cell lung cancer and can occur in some neural tumors, activate MAPK and PI3K signaling to promote cell migration and invasion[19]. The presence of ALK and EML4 in the input list suggests that this fusion event may occur in some astrocytomas or related neural tumors. DPP6, a dipeptidyl peptidase, is involved in regulation of voltage-gated ion channels and may influence neuronal excitability; its role in astrocytoma migration is less well characterized but may relate to calcium signaling or neuronal interaction.\n\n## Neurotrophic Signaling and Survival Program\n\nNeurotrophic factors and their receptors are essential for neuronal survival, growth, and differentiation during development and in response to injury. While classical neurotrophic receptors (TrkA, TrkB, TrkC) are not directly in the input list, genes encoding their co-receptors and signaling effectors are present. p75 neurotrophin receptor (NTR) signaling, which can promote either survival or apoptosis depending on context, is suggested by the presence of TNFRSF12A (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 12A, also known as TWEAK receptor). TNFRSF12A mediates signaling by TWEAK, a TNF-related ligand that promotes inflammation, cell survival, and in some contexts, cell death. In astrocytomas, TWEAK-TNFRSF12A signaling could promote inflammatory microenvironment changes that support tumor growth.\n\nFGF14 (fibroblast growth factor 14) is an intracellular FGF that modulates neuronal excitability and is expressed in the nervous system. FGFR1 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 1), while not directly in the list, is a key receptor for FGF signaling in brain development and glioma progression; the presence of multiple FGF pathway regulators suggests that FGF signaling may be dysregulated in these astrocytomas. Neurotrophic signaling often converges on PI3K-Akt-mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways to promote survival and growth, pathways that are dysregulated in most high-grade astrocytomas.\n\n## Chromatin Remodeling and Epigenetic Program\n\nEpigenetic dysregulation is a hallmark of cancer, with alterations in DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin accessibility driving oncogenic gene expression patterns. The input list contains several genes implicated in chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation: ATOH1 (atonal bHLH transcription factor 1), which regulates neuronal differentiation; EVI5 (ecotropic viral integration site 5), a centrosome-associated protein that may influence chromatin organization; and L3MBTL4 (lethal 3-like MBT repeat-containing 4), which is involved in chromatin compaction. While ATRX (ATRX chromatin remodeler), a critical gene in astrocytoma pathogenesis, is not in the input list, its mention in the search results[33][54] highlights the importance of chromatin dysregulation in these tumors.\n\nIDH mutations, the most common molecular alteration in lower-grade gliomas and IDH-mutant astrocytomas, drive global changes in DNA methylation through altered 2-ketoglutarate-dependent TET enzyme function, resulting in an IDH-mutant CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP). The astrocytoma metabolic program, combined with altered chromatin states, is expected to promote aberrant gene expression patterns that support transformation and invasion.\n\n## Non-Coding RNA Regulatory Program\n\nA substantial portion of the input gene list comprises long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and other non-coding transcripts: MIR4435-2HG, CHRM3-AS2, ADAMTS9-AS1, HMGA2-AS1, PCDH9-AS2, GNG12-AS1, LINC02742, LINC01138, LINC01798, LINC00266-1, and AC-prefixed sequences representing unannotated or novel transcripts. Long non-coding RNAs regulate gene expression at multiple levels, including transcriptional regulation through chromatin remodeling, post-transcriptional splicing and stability, and miRNA sponging. The specific roles of many lncRNAs in astrocytoma are not yet fully characterized, but evidence indicates that dysregulation of lncRNA expression contributes to glioma progression.\n\nMIR4435-2HG is a lncRNA with known roles in cancer; ADAMTS9-AS1, an antisense lncRNA to ADAMTS9, may regulate the expression of this ECM protease. In Alzheimer's disease gene co-expression network analysis, multiple lncRNAs were identified as AD-specific hub genes annotated to cytoskeleton organization, mitochondrial function, and neurogenesis[9]. Given the overlaps between Alzheimer's disease and astrocytoma transcriptomes (particularly in chronic injury states), dysregulation of these lncRNAs in astrocytomas may similarly influence cytoskeletal remodeling and metabolic function. Long non-coding RNAs and other regulatory RNAs are increasingly recognized as critical controllers of cancer cell phenotypes and therapeutic resistance.\n\n## Conclusion: Integrating Gene Programs in Astrocytoma Pathogenesis\n\nThe 170 genes provided constitute a remarkably comprehensive molecular signature spanning eleven distinct biological programs that collectively orchestrate the transformation, invasion, metabolic reprogramming, and neural interaction phenotypes characteristic of astrocytomas. No single program operates in isolation; rather, they interact through multiple regulatory nodes and feedback loops to shape the overall phenotype of neoplastic astrocytes. For example, integrin signaling (adhesion program) converges with Rho GTPase signaling (cytoskeletal program) to control cell migration and invasion. Kinase signaling (proliferation program) integrates with calcium signaling and transcriptional regulation to control both cell cycle progression and differentiation state. Metabolic reprogramming (metabolic program) provides the energetic and biosynthetic substrate for rapid growth while adapting to brain-specific constraints. Synaptic protein dysregulation (neuron-tumor interaction program) enables extensive crosstalk with the neuronal microenvironment, promoting seizures, neuroinflammation, and potentially drug resistance.\n\nThe dysregulation of negative feedback regulators (RGS, Sprouty, Spred proteins) combined with activation of kinase cascades creates a permissive environment for sustained proliferation and migration. Dedifferentiation through altered transcriptional programs preserves stemness and self-renewal capacity. Invasion is enabled through coordinated ECM remodeling, adhesion modulation, and Rho-mediated cytoskeletal dynamics. Metabolic switching provides the bioenergetic demands of rapid growth. Neuronal interactions create a permissive microenvironment and may serve as a source of growth-promoting signals.\n\nUnderstanding astrocytomas as a coordinated dysregulation of these gene programs, rather than isolated gene mutations, provides a more mechanistically complete picture of transformation and progression. Therapeutic interventions targeting single pathways have generally proven insufficient in glioma; a systems perspective incorporating multiple gene programs may yield more effective multi-pronged therapeutic strategies. The JSON output below encodes these programs and their supporting evidence in a structured format for computational analysis and integration with other data modalities.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"cell_type\": \"Astrocyte\",\n    \"disease\": \"Astrocytoma\",\n    \"tissue\": \"Brain\"\n  },\n  \"input_genes\": [\n    \"CAMK2D\",\n    \"MIR4435-2HG\",\n    \"CDK6\",\n    \"CYTOR\",\n    \"CHRM3\",\n    \"RGS6\",\n    \"KIAA1211L\",\n    \"KLHL4\",\n    \"CDH2\",\n    \"HIVEP3\",\n    \"SPRY4\",\n    \"TRIO\",\n    \"ADAMTS9\",\n    \"WWTR1\",\n    \"SPRED2\",\n    \"VAV3\",\n    \"PLAT\",\n    \"SATB2\",\n    \"CHRM3-AS2\",\n    \"SIPA1L1\",\n    \"GAP43\",\n    \"KCNIP1\",\n    \"PCNX2\",\n    \"GRIA3\",\n    \"ILDR2\",\n    \"IL1RAP\",\n    \"AC092691.1\",\n    \"CPNE4\",\n    \"IQGAP2\",\n    \"BCAT1\",\n    \"TRIM9\",\n    \"LRATD1\",\n    \"NOVA1\",\n    \"METTL7B\",\n    \"JAG1\",\n    \"DENND2A\",\n    \"PALM2-AKAP2\",\n    \"SPRED1\",\n    \"NRCAM\",\n    \"FREM2\",\n    \"DPF3\",\n    \"SPATA6\",\n    \"CNKSR2\",\n    \"HS2ST1\",\n    \"TNFRSF12A\",\n    \"GLDC\",\n    \"MYO16\",\n    \"CHL1\",\n    \"CDK14\",\n    \"CDH4\",\n    \"NEK6\",\n    \"STK17A\",\n    \"STK32A\",\n    \"STK32B\",\n    \"MED12L\",\n    \"CAMK2B\",\n    \"ARHGEF26\",\n    \"ARSJ\",\n    \"C6ORF141\",\n    \"GALR1\",\n    \"PTPRZ1\",\n    \"SH3PXD2B\",\n    \"RHOJ\",\n    \"SHROOM3\",\n    \"ITGB8\",\n    \"CREB5\",\n    \"AC092958.1\",\n    \"INSYN2A\",\n    \"LYST\",\n    \"CSMD2\",\n    \"ITGA3\",\n    \"ITGA7\",\n    \"KLHL29\",\n    \"AC124254.2\",\n    \"DPP6\",\n    \"KANK1\",\n    \"ZDHHC14\",\n    \"PREX1\",\n    \"P2RY14\",\n    \"AC004828.2\",\n    \"SLC35F1\",\n    \"CPNE8\",\n    \"TANC1\",\n    \"IGF2BP2\",\n    \"EML4\",\n    \"ADAM19\",\n    \"COL22A1\",\n    \"ACSS3\",\n    \"SRPX\",\n    \"FRMD5\",\n    \"MEIS1\",\n    \"ESR2\",\n    \"SEMA5A\",\n    \"ENC1\",\n    \"SYNJ2\",\n    \"COL4A2\",\n    \"MEG8\",\n    \"SEMA3E\",\n    \"MAP3K1\",\n    \"POSTN\",\n    \"DLC1\",\n    \"DNMBP\",\n    \"ETV5\",\n    \"DEC1\",\n    \"ABCC3\",\n    \"LONRF2\",\n    \"CEMIP\",\n    \"LINC02742\",\n    \"SHISA9\",\n    \"ETV6\",\n    \"MAMLD1\",\n    \"ERI1\",\n    \"FGF14\",\n    \"SNTG1\",\n    \"FNDC3B\",\n    \"CLMN\",\n    \"SPRY2\",\n    \"PRAG1\",\n    \"SLC8A1\",\n    \"LSAMP\",\n    \"LMO2\",\n    \"DNM1\",\n    \"PDE8A\",\n    \"AC087564.1\",\n    \"GRIK2\",\n    \"RCAN1\",\n    \"GRIN2B\",\n    \"ALK\",\n    \"VMP1\",\n    \"AL356124.1\",\n    \"LEF1\",\n    \"HMGA2\",\n    \"HMGA2-AS1\",\n    \"LDLRAD3\",\n    \"IGF2BP3\",\n    \"PCDH7\",\n    \"LAMC1\",\n    \"PCDH9-AS2\",\n    \"TRPM3\",\n    \"ACSBG1\",\n    \"NES\",\n    \"ADGRL3\",\n    \"ADAM12\",\n    \"HS3ST5\",\n    \"ADAMTS9-AS1\",\n    \"MTCL1\",\n    \"UBASH3B\",\n    \"ARHGAP26\",\n    \"RASSF8\",\n    \"AC017002.5\",\n    \"PGAP1\",\n    \"LIMK1\",\n    \"RYR3\",\n    \"AC060834.2\",\n    \"ZMAT4\",\n    \"KCNMA1\",\n    \"SCD5\",\n    \"SAMD4A\",\n    \"RUNX1\",\n    \"NPAS3\",\n    \"AC064875.1\",\n    \"SCG2\",\n    \"GAS2\",\n    \"OSBP2\",\n    \"PDGFA\",\n    \"LAMA4\",\n    \"SLC35F4\",\n    \"EMP1\",\n    \"KCND2\",\n    \"DPYSL5\",\n    \"RFFL\",\n    \"KALRN\",\n    \"ITPR2\",\n    \"LAMA2\",\n    \"SLC1A2\",\n    \"ELOVL2\",\n    \"L3MBTL4\",\n    \"DPY19L1\",\n    \"RBPMS\",\n    \"RGS17\",\n    \"LPAR1\",\n    \"DUSP6\",\n    \"LINC01138\",\n    \"RNF157\",\n    \"PXYLP1\",\n    \"LHFPL6\",\n    \"FBN2\",\n    \"RUBCNL\",\n    \"FGFR1\",\n    \"SH3KBP1\",\n    \"GRB10\",\n    \"GPR158\",\n    \"LINC01798\",\n    \"EPHA3\",\n    \"PTPRJ\",\n    \"GNG12-AS1\",\n    \"PRKD1\",\n    \"PVT1\",\n    \"LINC00266-1\",\n    \"SEMA3A\"\n  ],\n  \"programs\": [\n    {\n      \"program_name\": \"Integrin-Mediated Cell Adhesion and Mechanotransduction\",\n      \"description\": \"This program orchestrates cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix and neighboring cells through integrin heterodimers, focal adhesion complexes, and downstream mechanotransduction signaling.

Recent evidence demonstrates that astrocytic mitochondrial connexin-43 directly regulates IDH3α to maintain glycolytic metabolism and lactate production for neuronal energy supply; dysregulation of this coupling in astrocytomas would promote metabolic reprogramming.

ELOVL2 elongates polyunsaturated fatty acids for membrane incorporation and signaling lipid synthesis. Recent work has demonstrated that dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism genes (PPARG, ACSL5) by the JAB1/CRL4B complex in breast cancer promotes cell proliferation and invasion. Metabolic dysregulation in astrocytomas would promote adaptation to the brain microenvironment, support rapid growth, and potentially contribute to therapeutic resistance.\",\n      \"significance_score\": 0.72,\n      \"citations\": [\n        {\n          \"source_id\": \"4\",\n          \"notes\": \"JAB1 represses PPARG and ACSL5 fatty acid metabolism genes in cancer\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"source_id\": \"9\",\n          \"notes\": \"Metabolic dysregulation in AD with implications for cancer metabolism\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"supporting_genes\": [\n        \"BCAT1\",\n        \"GLDC\",\n        \"ACSBG1\",\n        \"ACSS3\",\n        \"ELOVL2\",\n        \"OSBP2\",\n        \"VMP1\",\n        \"IGF2BP2\",\n        \"IGF2BP3\"\n      ],\n      \"required_genes_not_in_input\": {\n        \"genes\": [\n          \"LDHA\",\n          \"PKM2\",\n          \"GLS1\",\n          \"GLUT1\",\n          \"ACC1\"\n        ],\n        \"citations\": [\n          {\n            \"source_id\": \"9\",\n            \"notes\": \"LDHA catalyzes lactate production; PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2) is a key glycolytic enzyme; GLS1 catalyzes glutaminolysis; these are essential for metabolic reprogramming\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"program_name\": \"Cell Migration and Directional Guidance\",\n      \"description\": \"Cell migration requires coordinated regulation of adhesion, cytoskeletal dynamics, and directional sensing through guidance cues.

These programs are not isolated entities but rather form a highly interconnected network where dysregulation of one program propagates to affect others. For example, integrin signaling converges with Rho GTPase signaling through multiple feedback loops to control migration. Metabolic reprogramming provides the bioenergetic substrate for the kinase cascades driving proliferation. Calcium signaling integrates signals from multiple receptor types (glutamate receptors, purinergic receptors, muscarinic receptors) to control both tumor cell fate and neuron-astrocyte interactions.\n\nThe input gene list represents a molecular signature of astrocytoma that, when integrated as these functional programs, provides a comprehensive picture of transformation, invasion, and microenvironment interaction. Future therapeutic strategies targeting astrocytomas should consider the coordinated dysregulation of these programs and employ multi-pronged approaches targeting multiple programs simultaneously. Single-pathway inhibition has proven insufficient in glioma therapy due to the redundancy and interconnectedness of these dysregulated programs; understanding them as integrated functional modules may enable more effective therapeutic intervention.",

Integrin alpha and beta subunits form heterodimeric complexes that bind extracellular matrix ligands (collagen, laminin, fibronectin) and transduce mechanical tension into biochemical signals that control cell migration, invasion, and gene expression through FAK and YAP/TAZ signaling. Talin proteins directly link integrins to the actin cytoskeleton and sense mechanical forces. Laminin and collagen chains serve as primary ECM ligands. This program is dysregulated in astrocytomas to promote invasion through tumor-infiltrated brain parenchyma and blood vessels.",

ITPR2, a key component of ER calcium release, drives mitochondrial calcium accumulation and mitochondrial permeability transition pore activation, leading to reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS production, and cell dysfunction. In the context of cancer, dysregulation of calcium signaling can promote metabolic reprogramming (particularly toward glycolysis), affect survival signaling, and enhance migration. The presence of glutamate receptor subunits in astrocytomas is particularly striking, as it suggests that tumor cells may directly respond to synaptic glutamate or even express and release glutamate themselves, creating aberrant calcium-dependent signaling that affects both tumor cells and neighboring neurons. Recent evidence demonstrates that astrocytic mitochondrial connexin-43 directly regulates IDH3α to maintain glycolytic metabolism and lactate production for neuronal energy supply; dysregulation of this coupling in astrocytomas would promote metabolic reprogramming. The calcium signaling program is therefore predicted to promote metabolic reprogramming, migration, and pathological neuron-tumor interactions.",

POSTN, a matricellular protein, was recently demonstrated to promote sarcoma growth and metastasis through recruitment and polarization of tumor-associated macrophages; analysis of human sarcoma data revealed that high POSTN expression correlates with poor prognosis and elevated ECM-related and myeloid cell-associated genes. In astrocytomas, periostin is often upregulated and likely promotes invasion through both direct effects on astrocytoma cells and indirect effects through immune cell recruitment. The synthesis of matrix components (laminin, collagen, fibronectin) by astrocytoma cells supports the establishment of a permissive microenvironment. The coordinated dysregulation of matrix proteases, matrix synthesis, and matricellular signaling creates a robust program of invasion and microenvironment remodeling central to astrocytoma progression.",

The Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis despite adequate oxygen) is characteristic of high-grade gliomas and supports rapid ATP production, NADPH generation for biosynthesis and antioxidant defense, and intermediate precursors for biomass accumulation. The branched-chain amino acid transaminase BCAT1 is frequently upregulated in gliomas and catalyzes the transamination of leucine, isoleucine, and valine to branched-chain alpha-ketoacids, linking amino acid and energy metabolism. The glycine cleavage system (GLDC) converts glycine to one-carbon units and ammonia, supporting folate-mediated biosynthesis. Fatty acid synthesis is enhanced to support rapid membrane production; ACSBG1 and ACSS3 activate short- and medium-chain fatty acids for entry into lipogenic pathways. ELOVL2 elongates polyunsaturated fatty acids for membrane incorporation and signaling lipid synthesis. Recent work has demonstrated that dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism genes (PPARG, ACSL5) by the JAB1/CRL4B complex in breast cancer promotes cell proliferation and invasion.

Recent gene co-expression network analysis in Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative condition with overlapping transcriptomic features with brain tumors, identified multiple lncRNAs as disease-specific hub genes associated with altered cytoskeleton organization, mitochondrial function, and neurogenesis. The lncRNA POC1B-AS1, for example, was associated with cytoskeleton organization in Alzheimer's disease networks but with mitochondrial energy production in control networks, suggesting a gain of function related to disease pathology. Similarly, FBXW7-AS1, Lnc-PDE4D-2, and others were functionally assigned only within disease networks. In the context of astrocytomas, dysregulation of lncRNAs likely contributes to the altered transcriptional and post-transcriptional landscapes characteristic of malignant transformation. LncRNAs can regulate gene expression through multiple mechanisms: by serving as scaffolds for chromatin-modifying complexes, by regulating mRNA splicing and stability, or by functioning as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) that sponge miRNAs away from their mRNA targets. The substantial number of lncRNAs in the input list suggests that lncRNA dysregulation is a significant feature of the astrocytoma transcriptome.",
