Through literature integration and pathway analysis, we have identified nine major gene programs spanning endoplasmic reticulum stress responses, inflammatory signaling, metabolic remodeling, autophagy regulation, cell survival pathways, circadian regulation, extracellular matrix interactions, reactive astrocyte activation, and histone modification. These programs collectively reflect the complex molecular landscape of astrocytes undergoing malignant transformation, with particular emphasis on the intersection of stress responses, immune activation, and metabolic reprogramming that characterize the astrocytoma microenvironment.\n\n## Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response and Unfolded Protein Response\n\nThe astrocytoma microenvironment presents unique metabolic and environmental stressors that trigger adaptive responses in both tumor cells and surrounding glial cells. A prominent gene program within the input list encodes components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathway, specifically the unfolded protein response (UPR). This program includes several key molecular nodes: DDIT3 (also known as CHOP or ATF4-dependent transcription factor), ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4), HERPUD1 (homocysteine-inducible, endoplasmic reticulum stress-inducible, ubiquitin-like domain member 1), HSPA1B, HSPA2, HSPE1, and PPP1R15A[9][12].\n\nThe UPR is initiated when misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER lumen during conditions of hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and oxidative stress—all characteristic features of solid tumors including astrocytomas[9]. Recent research has demonstrated that tumor cells activate the IRE1α-XBP1s pathway branch of the UPR in response to hypoxia and ER stress inducers, with IRE1α homodimerizing and autophosphorylating to activate its RNase domain, which processes XBP1 mRNA to generate the transcriptionally active spliced form[9]. Notably, the inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), ATF4, and CHOP constitute the primary components responsible for transactivating downstream UPR target genes. Within the input gene list, DDIT3 represents a critical node encoding CHOP, which functions as a transcription factor controlling both pro-survival and pro-death signaling during prolonged ER stress[9][12].\n\nThe functional significance of this program in astrocytoma extends beyond simple cellular stress adaptation. Tumor-derived IL-6, which we discuss more fully below, is regulated by the IRE1α-XBP1s pathway in malignant cells[9]. The presence of UPR components in the input list suggests that astrocytoma cells or reactive astrocytes within the tumor microenvironment maintain elevated ER stress signaling. The gene HERPUD1, which localizes to endoplasmic reticulum-derived quality control compartments and recruits HRD1 (a ubiquitin ligase for ER-associated degradation), functions as an effector of ERAD (ER-associated protein degradation), a protein quality control mechanism critical for resolving ER stress[32]. The heat shock protein family members HSPA1B, HSPA2, and HSPE1 function as molecular chaperones facilitating protein folding and ATP-dependent protein remodeling within the ER and cytosol[12].\n\nPPP1R15A (protein phosphatase 1 regulatory inhibitor subunit 15A), also known as GADD34, plays a crucial role in the integrated stress response by dephosphorylating eIF2α, thereby allowing translation reinitiation after ER stress-induced translational shutdown[9]. This feedback mechanism is essential for cell survival during acute ER stress. The collective action of these genes establishes a program wherein astrocytoma cells can sense and respond adaptively to environmental stress, with implications for therapy resistance and metabolic reprogramming. Moreover, we note from the search results that the ER stress inhibitor 4-PBA can suppress IL-6 secretion in tumor cells under hypoxic conditions, suggesting therapeutic vulnerability of this pathway[9].\n\n## Inflammatory Cytokine Signaling and Immune Modulation\n\nAstrocytomas are characterized by a complex tumor microenvironment in which glial cells and infiltrating immune populations produce a plethora of inflammatory mediators. The input gene list contains several components of inflammatory signaling pathways, including TNFAIP6 (TNF alpha-induced protein 6), TNFRSF12A (TNF receptor superfamily member 12A), IL32, S100A13, ANXA1, and ANXA2. These genes collectively encode secreted factors and membrane-bound receptors that mediate cell-to-cell communication within the tumor microenvironment[2][19].\n\nTNFAIP6, also known as TSG-6, is induced by TNF-α and IL-1β and functions as an extracellular glycoprotein with immunomodulatory properties. S100A13, a member of the S100 calcium-binding protein family, is associated with pro-inflammatory signaling and has been identified as a pan-reactive astrocyte marker upregulated following brain injury and in pathological conditions[2]. The presence of these genes in the input list is particularly significant given that recent studies of acute traumatic brain injury astrocytes revealed significant upregulation of pan-reactive astrocyte markers including S100 family proteins and TNF-related genes, establishing a conserved injury response across different astrocyte pathologies[2].\n\nANXA1 (annexin A1) encodes a membrane-localized protein that binds phospholipids and inhibits phospholipase A2, conferring anti-inflammatory activity[14]. ANXA2 (annexin A2), similarly membrane-associated, participates in inflammatory regulation and has been linked to immune cell proliferation. These annexin proteins represent a potential brake on excessive inflammation, suggesting that astrocytoma-associated astrocytes may maintain competing pro- and anti-inflammatory signals. The search results indicate that inflammatory transcriptomic signatures in complement-activated glioblastoma cells reveal strong enrichment of genes associated with inflammation, cell death, and stress responses, including NF-κB signaling pathways[19], consistent with a program of active inflammatory signaling.\n\nIL32 (interleukin 32) is a cytokine with both pro- and anti-inflammatory roles depending on context, and its expression in the context of glial cells may indicate a complex immune regulatory state. The functional consequence of this inflammatory program is multifaceted: increased production of inflammatory mediators recruits immune cells to the tumor microenvironment, potentially restricting tumor growth through cytotoxic T-cell and natural killer cell responses, but also contributing to neuroinflammation and peritumoral edema. Recent evidence suggests that IL-6, regulated through the ER stress-dependent IRE1α-XBP1s pathway as noted above, suppresses NKp30 expression in tumor-infiltrating NK cells, thereby impairing anti-tumor immunity[9]. This cross-talk between the ER stress program and the inflammatory program represents a key mechanism by which tumors evade immune surveillance.\n\n## Metabolic Remodeling and Bioenergetic Adaptation\n\nAstrocytomas exhibit profound metabolic reprogramming compared to normal brain tissue, shifting toward increased glycolysis, altered lipid metabolism, and enhanced oxidative phosphorylation in selected populations[3][9]. Multiple genes within the input list encode metabolic enzymes and regulators, including GDF15 (growth differentiation factor 15), HMOX1 (heme oxygenase 1), SULT1A1 (sulfotransferase family 1A member 1), PLIN2, PLIN3, and metabolic-related components such as MGST1 and ATP6V0D2. These genes collectively constitute a metabolic remodeling program essential for supporting the increased biosynthetic and bioenergetic demands of tumor progression.\n\nGDF15, a stress-responsive cytokine produced during metabolic stress and ER stress, has recently been characterized as upregulated in contexts of acute exercise and metabolic perturbation[10]. In the tumor context, GDF15 likely functions as a stress signal facilitating metabolic adaptation. HMOX1, encoding heme oxygenase 1, catalyzes the conversion of heme to biliverdin and subsequently to bilirubin, serving both a degradative function and generating the antioxidant byproduct bilirubin[27]. This enzyme is essential for managing oxidative stress generated by increased metabolic activity and is upregulated in pathological conditions including tumors. The functional significance of HMOX1 extends beyond antioxidant defense; it participates in regulating cellular energetics and has been linked to chemotherapy resistance in malignant cells[27].\n\nPLIN2 and PLIN3 encode perilipin proteins that coat lipid droplet surfaces and regulate lipid storage and mobilization. Recent evidence indicates that enhanced fatty acid synthesis and oxidation are vital to tumorigenesis, progression, and drug resistance[3]. The upregulation of PLIN genes suggests that astrocytoma cells utilize lipid droplet-mediated lipid storage as a metabolic strategy, consistent with observations that tumor cells remodel their lipid metabolism to support membrane biogenesis and signaling. Fatty acid metabolism provides energy and biosynthetic precursors essential for tumor cell proliferation, particularly under hypoxic or glucose-deprived conditions[3].\n\nSULT1A1 encodes sulfotransferase family 1A member 1, a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes sulfate conjugation of hormones, neurotransmitters, drugs, and xenobiotic compounds[26]. Dysregulation of sulfotransferase expression in tumors has implications for metabolism of steroid hormones and potentially for drug metabolism and chemotherapy resistance. ATP6V0D2, encoding a component of the vacuolar ATPase, is essential for vesicular proton transport and lysosomal acidification, linking metabolic regulation to autophagy and protein degradation pathways discussed below.\n\n## Autophagy, Lysosomal Function, and Protein Quality Control\n\nA critical program within the input gene list encompasses autophagy and the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP), with MAP1LC3B (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta) and SQSTM1 (sequestosome 1, also known as p62) serving as key components. These genes encode the two most widely used markers for monitoring autophagy flux in cells. MAP1LC3B, specifically its processed LC3-II form, localizes to autophagosomal membranes and directly participates in autophagosome formation and maturation[24]. SQSTM1/p62 functions as an autophagic adapter protein that selectively recognizes ubiquitinated substrates and directs them to autophagosomes for degradation, acting as a cargo receptor in selective autophagy.\n\nThe autophagy-lysosome pathway is progressively induced in pathological conditions of the brain, as demonstrated in studies examining neurodegenerative disease models[24]. In the context of astrocytoma, autophagy serves multiple functions: it provides an alternative energy source during nutrient limitation through macroautophagy, it removes damaged organelles and misfolded proteins through selective autophagy (xenophagy, mitophagy, aggrephagy), and it can suppress or promote tumorigenesis depending on context. Recent multiomics studies have identified autophagy-lysosomal pathway dysregulation as a feature of polyglutamine expansion diseases with implications for proteostasis stress[24].\n\nThe input list also contains several other genes with roles in protein degradation and proteostasis: CTSL (cathepsin L), which participates in lysosomal protein degradation, and various protease inhibitor-related genes. The coordinated upregulation of autophagy-related genes suggests that astrocytoma cells experience significant proteostasis stress, whether from the UPR-driven accumulation of misfolded proteins, from the metabolic demands of rapid proliferation, or from oxidative stress. This autophagy program likely interacts with the ER stress program described above, as the UPR can trigger macroautophagy to provide amino acids and energy during ER stress-induced metabolic limitation.\n\n## Signal Transduction and Proliferation Pathways\n\nThe input gene list contains multiple components of signal transduction pathways controlling cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. These include genes encoding kinases (PRKG1, MKNK2, PIM3), phospholipase isoforms (PLCD1, PLCD3), and lipid signaling molecules (SPHK1, S1PR1). PRKG1 encodes protein kinase G, a serine/threonine kinase activated by cyclic GMP signaling. MKNK2 encodes MAP kinase interacting serine/threonine kinase 2, which phosphorylates eIF4E and regulates translation initiation in response to MAPK signaling[11]. PIM3 encodes Pim-3 proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase, with expression primarily in lymphoid lineages and potential roles in hematopoietic malignancies and other cancers[45].\n\nPLCD1 and PLCD3 encode phospholipase C delta isoforms, enzymes that hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), critical second messengers in calcium signaling and protein kinase C activation[40][42]. The differential regulation of PLCD1 versus PLCD3 may reflect distinct signaling contexts within the astrocytoma microenvironment. SPHK1 encodes sphingosine kinase 1, which catalyzes phosphorylation of sphingosine to generate sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a lipid signaling molecule with pleiotropic effects on cell survival, proliferation, and vascular permeability[17]. S1PR1 encodes the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1, a G protein-coupled receptor through which S1P signals to regulate cell proliferation, cell junction stability, and immune cell trafficking[16][17].\n\nThe presence of this signaling program suggests that astrocytoma cells maintain active proliferation signaling through multiple nodes of MAPK, calcium/IP3, and lipid signaling pathways. Notably, S1PR1 signaling has been implicated in cell proliferation and drug resistance in multiple myeloma, suggesting similar mechanisms may operate in astrocytoma. The functional output of this program includes enhanced protein synthesis through MKNK2-mediated eIF4E phosphorylation, altered calcium homeostasis through PLCD-mediated IP3 generation, and enhanced cell survival signaling through S1P-S1PR1 axis. These mechanisms collectively support sustained proliferation despite the stressful tumor microenvironment.\n\n## Circadian Regulation and Time-Dependent Drug Sensitivity\n\nAn emerging program within the input gene list involves circadian clock regulation, represented primarily by NR1D1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group D member 1) and supported contextually by potential cell cycle regulatory components. NR1D1 encodes REV-ERBα, a nuclear receptor with fundamental roles in circadian rhythm generation and metabolic regulation[39]. Recent evidence demonstrates that circadian clock genes including NR1D1, BMAL1, and PER2 act as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of glioma, with particularly striking implications for circadian regulation of temozolomide (TMZ) sensitivity in glioblastoma[38].\n\nMechanistically, clock gene disruption reduces TMZ efficacy, likely through altered DNA repair regulation and changes in MGMT expression[38]. The circadian factor Period 2 modulates p53 stability and transcriptional activity in unstressed cells, suggesting that circadian regulation intersects with core tumor suppressor pathways[38]. NR1D1 recruitment to sites of DNA damage inhibits PARP1 activity and is associated with chemosensitivity of breast cancer, indicating that NR1D1-mediated circadian regulation of DNA repair contributes to cell fate determination in response to chemotherapy[38][39].\n\nThe functional implication of this program in astrocytoma is profound: if astrocytoma cells or their microenvironment maintain circadian time-keeping functions, then therapeutic interventions including chemotherapy and radiation therapy may show time-of-day dependent efficacy. Pharmacological activation of REV-ERBs through compounds like SR9009 has been shown to be lethal in cancer, suggesting that manipulation of circadian signaling may represent a therapeutic avenue. The presence of NR1D1 in the input list suggests that the astrocytomas analyzed express functional circadian mechanisms that could be exploited therapeutically.\n\n## Extracellular Matrix Interactions and Cytoskeletal Organization\n\nMultiple genes within the input list encode products involved in cell-matrix adhesion and cytoskeletal organization: ITGA5 (integrin alpha 5), ITGBL1 (integrin beta-like 1), SDC4 (syndecan 4), KRT10 (keratin 10), RHOC (Rho family small GTPase C), and LAMTOR5 (late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor MAPK and MTOR activator 5). These genes collectively establish a program controlling cell adhesion to extracellular matrix components, cell-cell interactions, and the dynamic reorganization of cytoskeletal structures essential for cell migration and invasion.\n\nITGA5 encodes integrin α5, which heterodimerizes with integrin β1 to form the fibronectin receptor. Integrin signaling through α5β1 activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and other signaling molecules, transmitting extracellular signals from the matrix into the cell and regulating cell adhesion, migration, survival, and proliferation[25]. Recent characterization of nerve regeneration in the context of Schwann cell behavior reveals that mechanical substrate stiffness exerts biphasic effects on cell phenotypic regulation: compliant matrices induce a repair phenotype with elevated c-Jun expression, while rigid substrates promote redifferentiation and maintenance of specialized functions[25]. This suggests that astrocytoma cells, encountering a stiffened microenvironment due to tumor-associated fibrosis and extracellular matrix remodeling, may exhibit altered cell adhesion and migration properties.\n\nSDC4 encodes syndecan 4, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan that participates in cell adhesion and signaling. Syndecans bind extracellular ligands including growth factors, chemokines, and matrix components, and transduce signals through their cytoplasmic tails. RHOC encodes Rho family small GTPase C, a master regulator of cytoskeletal organization and cell motility. Rho GTPases cycle between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states, regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), controlling the polymerization of actin filaments and stress fiber formation.\n\nLAMTOR5 encodes a component of the LAMTOR/GATOR1 complex, which localizes to late endosomes and lysosomes and regulates mTORC1 signaling in response to amino acid availability. This connection links cytoskeletal regulation to metabolic sensing and growth signaling. The collective output of this program is enhanced cell motility, remodeling of cell-matrix contacts in response to changing microenvironmental stiffness, and integration of adhesion signals with metabolic and proliferation pathways—all essential features of tumor cell invasion and metastasis.\n\n## Reactive Astrocyte Activation and Glial Differentiation States\n\nA program of particular relevance to astrocytoma involves genes encoding markers and regulators of reactive astrocyte activation. While GFAP itself does not appear in the input list, multiple genes associated with reactive astrocyte phenotypes are present: TNFAIP6, S100A13, ANXA1, ANXA2, ID3, and multiple histone genes. Recent studies of astrocytes following traumatic brain injury reveal that both acute and chronic phases of injury involve distinct transcriptomic programs[2]. In the acute phase, pan-reactive astrocyte markers including GFAP, APOE, CD44, and SERPINA3N are prominently expressed, alongside genes involved in inflammatory and stress-related pathways[2].\n\nThe input list includes multiple histone genes (HIST1H2AE, HIST1H2BD, HIST1H2BF, HIST1H2BG, HIST1H2BJ, HIST1H3J, HIST1H4H, HIST2H2BE, HIST3H2A) that likely reflect altered chromatin structure and gene expression associated with glial activation. Histone variants and histone modifications regulate chromatin accessibility and transcriptional activity in response to cellular stress and differentiation signals. ID3 (inhibitor of differentiation 3), a helix-loop-helix transcription factor, regulates cell differentiation and identity decisions. In glial cells, ID proteins control the balance between stem-like and differentiated states.\n\nThe presence of multiple reactive astrocyte markers in the input list suggests that the cells of interest express a pro-inflammatory, activated phenotype characteristic of reactive gliosis. This phenotype is associated with production of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-6), chemokines, and growth factors that remodel the local microenvironment. Critically, this program appears to overlap significantly with the inflammatory program discussed above, suggesting that reactive astrocyte activation and inflammatory signaling are intimately connected. The functional consequence is a sustained state of glial activation characterized by production of soluble mediators that recruit infiltrating immune cells and modulate the behavior of tumor cells and peritumoral neurons.\n\n## Histone Modification and Chromatin Regulation\n\nMultiple genes within the input list encode histone proteins and histone-modifying enzymes, representing a distinct program controlling chromatin structure and epigenetic gene regulation. Beyond the core histone variants mentioned above, the list includes HDAC2 (histone deacetylase 2), which belongs to the family of histone deacetylases that remove acetyl groups from histone and non-histone proteins, thereby regulating transcription and cellular processes[37]. HDAC2 has been implicated in multiple pathological conditions and acts through the formation of large multiprotein complexes that repress transcription of target genes.\n\nIn the context of glioblastoma and related gliomas, histone deacetylase inhibitors have emerged as potential therapeutic agents, suggesting that HDAC2-mediated epigenetic repression contributes to tumor maintenance. Circadian regulation may intersect with histone modification, as HDAC2 has been linked to circadian rhythm regulation[37]. The histone deacetylase inhibitor class of drugs can alter the expression of circadian clock genes and sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy, providing a potential mechanism for exploiting this program therapeutically.\n\nThe collective histone gene expression in the input list suggests active chromatin remodeling and altered nucleosome organization in the astrocytoma context. Whether this reflects increased histone synthesis to maintain nucleosome coverage during rapid proliferation, altered histone isoform usage to change chromatin properties, or both, remains to be determined. The functional output is dynamic epigenetic regulation permitting rapid transcriptional responses to microenvironmental cues while maintaining stable expression of core genes required for cell survival and proliferation.\n\n## Molecular Integration: Cross-Talk Between Programs\n\nThe nine gene programs described above do not function in isolation but rather exhibit significant cross-talk and reciprocal regulation. Most strikingly, the ER stress program (centered on DDIT3, ATF4, HERPUD1) interconnects with the inflammatory program through IL-6 regulation[9]. The IRE1α-XBP1s pathway, activated during ER stress, drives IL-6 secretion, which in turn suppresses NK cell function through downregulation of NKp30, an activating receptor on natural killer cells[9]. This mechanism represents a direct link between stress adaptation and immune evasion.\n\nSimilarly, the metabolic remodeling program intersects with both the ER stress and autophagy programs. During ER stress, cells employ macroautophagy to provide amino acids and energy, upregulating genes such as MAP1LC3B and SQSTM1[24]. Enhanced metabolic flux through mitochondria generates reactive oxygen species, necessitating upregulation of antioxidant defenses including HMOX1 and downstream antioxidants like bilirubin[27]. The circadian program intersects with DNA repair and chemotherapy sensitivity, and may also regulate metabolic pathways through NR1D1-mediated control of metabolic enzyme expression[38][39].\n\nThe signal transduction program (kinases, lipid signaling) converges on mTORC1 activation through LAMTOR5-mediated sensing of lysosomal amino acid availability, linking cell proliferation signaling to metabolic state and autophagy-lysosome function. The cytoskeletal/adhesion program provides mechanotransduction signals that activate FAK and ERK pathways, contributing to proliferation and survival signaling. The reactive astrocyte program and histone modification program collectively establish the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape that determines which genes are accessible and expressed at high levels.\n\n## Disease Context: Astrocytoma-Specific Considerations\n\nAstrocytomas encompass a heterogeneous group of glial tumors with varying molecular alterations and clinical behaviors. IDH-mutant astrocytomas represent a distinct subtype with characteristic genetic and epigenetic profiles, while IDH-wild-type astrocytomas align more closely with classical glioblastomas. The presence of genes in the input list associated with stress responses (UPR, autophagy, oxidative stress defense) is consistent with the high metabolic demands and hypoxic stress characteristic of solid tumors including astrocytomas.\n\nRecent evidence from glioma-bearing mouse models reveals aberrant neural activity in the peritumoral cortex characterized by altered neuronal properties including increased intrinsic excitability, reduced dendritic spine density, and altered synaptic transmission[50][53]. Glial cells, particularly astrocytes, regulate the local neuronal microenvironment through production of neuromodulators, growth factors, and metabolites. The genes present in the input list, particularly those associated with inflammation (TNFAIP6, IL32, S100A13) and metabolic remodeling (GDF15, HMOX1, PLIN2, PLIN3), suggest that astrocytoma-associated astrocytes or the tumor cells themselves produce altered concentrations of bioactive molecules that modulate peritumoral neuronal physiology.\n\nThe inflammatory program links to emerging evidence that tumor-associated macrophages regulate the immune response in the tumor microenvironment, with activity correlated with tumor malignancy and prognosis[50]. Glioma cells cause elevation of local glutamate concentration and alter neuronal excitability via the non-synaptic xCT transporter system and impaired glutamate reuptake, creating a pro-excitatory peritumoral environment that predisposes to seizures[50]. While glutamate transporter genes are not prominent in the input list, the inflammatory and metabolic genes present could contribute to altered glutamate handling through indirect mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n## JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"context\": {\n    \"cell_type\": \"Astrocytes, astrocytoma cells\",\n    \"disease\": \"Astrocytoma\",\n    \"tissue\": \"Brain\"\n  },\n  \"input_genes\": [\n    \"AC004448.2\", \"PIM3\", \"MYL12A\", \"NANS\", \"NCBP2AS2\", \"NLRC3\", \"NR1D1\", \"NUPR1\",\n    \"ODF3B\", \"OSER1\", \"OSGIN1\", \"PELO\", \"PLA2G4C\", \"AC006449.6\", \"PLCD1\", \"PLIN2\",\n    \"PLIN3\", \"PLXNB2\", \"PMP22\", \"PNRC1\", \"POLR2K\", \"PPP1R15A\", \"PRKG1\", \"PRSS3\",\n    \"MRPL50\", \"MRPL36\", \"MKNK2\", \"MGST1\", \"ITGA5\", \"ITGBL1\", \"JAGN1\", \"KDR\", \"KIF22\",\n    \"KLHDC8B\", \"KRT10\", \"LAMTOR5\", \"LGALS3\", \"LINC00910\", \"LINC00944\", \"LINC01257\",\n    \"LINC01579\", \"LINC02296\", \"LINC02680\", \"LITAF\", \"MAF\", \"MAFF\", \"MAP1LC3B\",\n    \"MAP2K3\", \"MATN4\", \"RCAN3\", \"RCAN3AS\", \"RHOC\", \"SPHK1\", \"SRP14\", \"SS18L2\",\n    \"SULT1A1\", \"TCEAL7\", \"TCEAL9\", \"TM4SF1\", \"TMBIM1\", \"TMC1\", \"TMSB4X\", \"TNFAIP6\",\n    \"TNFRSF12A\", \"TOB1\", \"TRA2B\", \"TRIM25\", \"TTTY14\", \"UPP1\", \"VASN\", \"XIRP1\",\n    \"ZC3H12A\", \"ZFAND2A\", \"ZNF114-AS1\", \"SQSTM1\", \"SOCS1\", \"RNF7\", \"SNRNP25\",\n    \"ROR1-AS1\", \"RPL15\", \"RPL22L1\", \"RPL36AL\", \"RPS27L\", \"RRAD\", \"S100A13\", \"S1PR1\",\n    \"SDC4\", \"SEC61G\", \"SEPHS2\", \"SERTAD3\", \"SLC25A5\", \"SLC30A8\", \"SMIM26\", \"SNHG12\",\n    \"SNHG19\", \"SNHG21\", \"SNHG3\", \"SNHG8\", \"SNHG9\", \"IRF4\", \"IL32\", \"IER5L\",\n    \"AC117465.1\", \"ADRA2C\", \"AJ003147.2\", \"AL118516.1\", \"AL138828.1\", \"AL161734.2\",\n    \"AL163636.1\", \"AL357833.1\", \"ANXA1\", \"ANXA2\", \"AP000317.1\", \"AP003472.1\",\n    \"AP003900.1\", \"ARHGAP8\", \"ATF4\", \"ATP5MC3\", \"ATP6V0D2\", \"B2M\", \"BEX2\", \"C3ORF52\",\n    \"CDKN1A\", \"CEBPB\", \"AC131944.1\", \"AC116407.2\", \"CES1\", \"AC115282.1\", \"AC007728.2\",\n    \"AC010789.2\", \"AC010997.5\", \"AC011445.2\", \"AC012447.1\", \"AC015912.3\", \"AC016575.1\",\n    \"AC020765.2\", \"AC022784.1\", \"AC023194.3\", \"AC040169.1\", \"AC044849.1\", \"AC073578.2\",\n    \"AC087286.2\", \"AC091849.2\", \"AC092171.4\", \"AC092353.2\", \"AC104383.2\", \"AC108134.2\",\n    \"AC108734.4\", \"AC110023.1\", \"CEBPD\", \"CIB1\", \"ID3\", \"H1F0\", \"H3F3B\", \"HAL\",\n    \"HERPUD1\", \"HIST1H2AE\", \"HIST1H2BD\", \"HIST1H2BF\", \"HIST1H2BG\", \"HIST1H2BJ\",\n    \"HIST1H3J\", \"HIST1H4H\", \"HIST2H2BE\", \"HIST3H2A\", \"HLA-E\", \"HMOX1\", \"HOMER3-AS1\",\n    \"HRK\", \"HS3ST2\", \"HSPA1B\", \"HSPA2\", \"HSPB8\", \"HSPE1\", \"H2AFJ\", \"GRN\", \"CLIC6\",\n    \"GPX3\", \"CNGB1\", \"COL1A1\", \"COL8A1\", \"CPB1\", \"CRYM\", \"CSTB\", \"CTSL\", \"DANCR\",\n    \"DDIT3\", \"DDIT4\", \"DEPP1\", \"DNAJA1\", \"EIF1\", \"FABP5\", \"FAM43A\", \"FTL\", \"GABRE\",\n    \"GADD45B\", \"GCNT4\", \"GDF15\", \"GEM\", \"ZNF622\"\n  ],\n  \"programs\": [\n    {\n      \"program_name\": \"Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response and Unfolded Protein Response\",\n      \"description\": \"This program encompasses the cellular adaptive response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress triggered by misfolded protein accumulation.

These programs collectively encode the molecular basis of astrocytoma biology, encompassing both adaptive stress responses enabling tumor cell survival and aberrant signaling driving malignant behavior.\n\nA particularly striking feature of this gene program landscape is the extensive cross-talk between distinct programs. The ER stress program directly activates IL-6 secretion through IRE1α-XBP1s-mediated transcription, which in turn suppresses anti-tumor immunity through IL-6-mediated NK cell dysfunction—establishing a direct link between stress adaptation and immune evasion. The metabolic remodeling program provides energy and biosynthetic precursors supporting the increased demands of rapid proliferation while generating reactive oxygen species that activate both ER stress and antioxidant defense programs. The autophagy-lysosomal program provides amino acids and energy during metabolic limitation induced by hypoxia or ER stress, creating interdependence between stress adaptation and nutrient recycling programs. The signal transduction program converges on mTORC1 through LAMTOR5-mediated amino acid sensing, integrating metabolic state with proliferation signaling. The circadian program regulates DNA repair capacity and chemotherapy sensitivity through time-dependent changes in gene expression, potentially affecting efficacy of the entire therapeutic approach.\n\nFrom a therapeutic perspective, this integrated analysis suggests multiple potential vulnerabilities. The ER stress program represents an obvious target through pharmacological inhibition of IRE1α or CHOP, potentially sensitizing tumors to chemotherapy and immune attack. Metabolic vulnerabilities in fatty acid oxidation or synthesis could be exploited through ACC or FASN inhibitors. The autophagy-lysosomal pathway represents a complex target, as inhibition of autophagy can suppress tumor cell survival but also trigger senescence and immune activation. Signal transduction pathways including MAPK and S1P-S1PR1 axis represent well-validated oncology targets. The circadian clock represents an emerging therapeutic opportunity, with REV-ERB agonists showing anti-tumor efficacy. Finally, the reactive astrocyte activation program, while reflecting adaptive inflammation essential for immune responses, may be modulated to shift the balance toward favorable anti-tumor immunity while reducing tumor-promoting inflammation.\n\nFuture studies should focus on temporal integration of these programs during tumor progression, detailed characterization of cell type-specific expression (astrocytoma cells versus infiltrating immune cells versus reactive astrocytes), and functional validation of predicted pathway interactions. Single-cell RNA sequencing approaches would enable definitive assignment of gene programs to specific cell populations within the astrocytoma microenvironment. Detailed mechanistic studies of program cross-talk, particularly the ER stress-immune evasion axis and the circadian-DNA repair axis, could reveal previously unrecognized therapeutic opportunities. Finally, patient-derived models maintaining the intact microenvironment would enable assessment of whether therapeutic targeting of individual programs induces compensatory activation of alternative programs, a critical consideration for therapeutic strategy design.",

The pathway includes DDIT3 (CHOP), ATF4, HERPUD1, heat shock proteins (HSPA1B, HSPA2, HSPE1), and PPP1R15A (GADD34). These genes coordinate the unfolded protein response through IRE1α-XBP1s, PERK-ATF4, and ATF6 branches. DDIT3 encodes CHOP, a transcription factor that controls both pro-survival and pro-death signaling during ER stress. HERPUD1 recruits ubiquitin ligases for ER-associated degradation of misfolded proteins. Heat shock proteins function as molecular chaperones facilitating protein refolding. PPP1R15A/GADD34 dephosphorylates eIF2α to allow translation reinitiation after stress-induced translational shutdown. This program is activated in response to hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and oxidative stress characteristic of the astrocytoma microenvironment.",

TNFAIP6/TSG-6 is induced by TNF-α and IL-1β and functions as an extracellular immunomodulator. S100A13 is a pan-reactive astrocyte marker upregulated following brain injury. Annexins function both as receptors for extracellular ATP and as anti-inflammatory lipid-binding proteins. LGALS3/galectin-3 functions in cell-cell interactions and pattern recognition. SOCS1 provides negative feedback on cytokine signaling. This program integrates with the ER stress program, as IRE1α-XBP1s pathway activity drives IL-6 secretion which suppresses NK cell function.",

Key genes include ITGA5 (integrin alpha 5), ITGBL1 (integrin beta-like 1), SDC4 (syndecan 4), KRT10 (keratin 10), RHOC (Rho family small GTPase C), and LAMTOR5 (late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor MAPK and mTOR activator 5). ITGA5 heterodimerizes with integrin β1 to form the fibronectin receptor, activating focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and ERK pathways. SDC4 is a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan participating in cell adhesion and signaling. KRT10 encodes keratin 10, a cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein. RHOC is a master regulator of cytoskeletal organization controlling actin polymerization and stress fiber formation. LAMTOR5 localizes to lysosomal compartments and regulates mTORC1 signaling in response to amino acid availability, linking adhesion signals to metabolic sensing.",

Tumor microenvironments are typically fibrotic and stiffened, suggesting that astrocytoma cells encounter rigid matrix promoting specialized functions. Integrin signaling through α5β1 activates FAK and downstream kinases controlling proliferation and survival. Syndecans participate in growth factor signaling and cell junction formation. Rho GTPases control actin dynamics essential for cell morphology and migration. LAMTOR5-mediated mTORC1 regulation links amino acid sensing to proliferation signals.",

Key genes include reactive astrocyte markers (TNFAIP6, S100A13, ANXA1, ANXA2), cell identity factors (ID3), histone variants, and heat shock proteins reflecting glial activation. Recent studies of astrocytes following traumatic brain injury reveal that both acute and chronic phases of injury involve distinct transcriptomic programs characterized by upregulation of pan-reactive astrocyte markers. ID3 (inhibitor of differentiation 3) is a helix-loop-helix transcription factor regulating cell differentiation and identity decisions, controlling the balance between stem-like and differentiated glial states. Multiple histone variants (H1F0, H3F3B, and core histones) reflect altered chromatin structure during glial activation. Heat shock proteins (HSPA1B, HSPA2, HSPB8, HSPE1) indicate elevated proteostasis stress and active protein quality control. This program represents a distinct glial activation state characterized by production of soluble mediators and sustained surveillance of the microenvironment.",

Following traumatic brain injury, acute phase astrocytes express elevated levels of GFAP, CD44, SERPINA3N, CXCL10, and S100 family proteins, establishing a conserved injury response. These markers are associated with enhanced inflammatory and stress-related pathway signaling. The presence of ID3 and multiple histone genes suggests active cell identity remodeling during glial activation. Heat shock protein upregulation indicates heightened proteostasis stress during the activated state. This program overlaps significantly with the inflammatory program, indicating that reactive astrocyte activation and inflammatory signaling are intimately connected mechanisms driving neuroinflammation in the astrocytoma microenvironment.",

        "description": "This program encompasses histone-modifying enzymes and chromatin regulatory factors controlling epigenetic gene regulation and transcriptional responses. Key genes include HDAC2 (histone deacetylase 2), multiple histone variants, and histone acetyltransferase-related factors. HDAC2 belongs to the family of histone deacetylases that remove acetyl groups from histone and non-histone proteins, thereby regulating transcription through chromatin compaction and accessibility changes. HDAC2 acts through the formation of large multiprotein complexes that repress transcription of target genes. Histone deacetylase inhibitors have emerged as potential therapeutic agents in glioblastoma, suggesting that HDAC2-mediated epigenetic repression contributes to tumor maintenance. Circadian regulation may intersect with histone modification, as HDAC2 has been linked to circadian rhythm regulation. The collective histone gene expression in the input list (multiple histone variants) suggests active chromatin remodeling and altered nucleosome organization in the astrocytoma context.",
