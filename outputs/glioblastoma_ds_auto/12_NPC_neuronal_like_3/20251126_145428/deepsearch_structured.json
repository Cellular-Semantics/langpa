SLC17A6 packages glutamate into synaptic vesicles, enabling glioma-neuron communication. PLCB1 mediates calcium-dependent second messenger generation. SYT1 and SYT4 are presynaptic vesicle calcium sensors required for glioma progression. Knockout or knockdown of these genes reduces glioma cell proliferation, expansion, and invasiveness.

This program encompasses GABAA receptor subunits (GABRB2, GABRA1), the somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2), and transcription factors controlling GABAergic interneuron identity (DLX5, DLX6). In the developing brain, GABA initially functions as an excitatory neurotransmitter before the developmental switch to inhibitory function. Dysregulation of GABAergic signaling in glioblastoma can promote tumor growth through altered inhibitory control of neuronal networks and may link to the high incidence of seizures in glioma patients.",

Mutations and altered expression of GABRB2 are associated with epilepsy, autism, and other neuropsychiatric disorders. GABRA1 encodes the α1 subunit, also critical for inhibitory function. Glioblastoma cells have been noted to upregulate GABA receptor expression when in proximity to neurons, enabling them to respond to GABAergic signaling. SSTR2 mediates somatostatin neuropeptide signaling and is upregulated following injury; activation of SSTR2 can contribute to neurodegeneration but also may link to tumor-immune interactions.

        "evidence_summary": "Neuronal activity-sensing pathways directly link excitatory input to glioblastoma proliferation. PRKCA encodes protein kinase C alpha, a serine/threonine kinase that integrates both calcium and phospholipid signals to control gene expression and cellular responses. In bag cell neurons, PKC activation enhances electrical synaptic transmission by increasing junctional conductance and recruiting postsynaptic calcium currents—mechanisms that could facilitate glioma-neuron communication. Notably, gain-of-function mutations in PRKCA have been identified in Alzheimer disease patients and are associated with increased cellular PKC activity; these variants mediate synaptic depression through amyloid-beta signaling, suggesting that dysregulated PKC activity contributes to neurodegeneration. In glioblastoma, enhanced PKC signaling could translate neuronal activity into proliferative signals. ADCY8 encodes adenylyl cyclase 8, which catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP—a critical second messenger linking activity to gene expression. Downstream effectors of cAMP signaling include protein kinase A (PKA) and CREB transcription factor phosphorylation, promoting neuronal growth and differentiation. In glioma, dysregulation of ADCY8-mediated cAMP generation could decouple these protective differentiation programs and instead redirect activity signals toward proliferation.",

Despite reduced overall FGFR2 levels, this receptor remains highly prevalent on glioblastoma stem cell populations in vitro, where it likely supports stemness properties. FGFR1 (not in input list but frequently co-expressed with FGFR2) is preferentially expressed on glioblastoma stem cells where it regulates SOX2, OLIG2, and ZEB1—key transcription factors promoting tumorigenicity and radioresistance. NRP1 is a multifunctional receptor for both VEGF and class 3 semaphorins; it acts as a co-receptor for VEGFR-2 to enhance VEGF signaling and promote developmental angiogenesis. In glioblastoma, NRP1-mediated VEGF signaling drives tumor vascularization and pathological angiogenesis; NRP1 hypomorphism or defective VEGF binding substantially reduces both developmental and tumor-associated neovascularization.
