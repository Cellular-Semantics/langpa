INPP4B demonstrates functional crosstalk between PI3K and Wnt signaling through phosphoinositide metabolism; its dual nature as oncogene in PIK3CA-mutant cancers shows pathway context-dependence. H1R activation drives proliferation through MAPK pathways; elevated expression correlates with poor survival in multiple cancers. NPR3 represents additional signaling complexity through cGMP-dependent mechanisms. The integration of these diverse pathways suggests tumors utilize multiple overlapping signaling inputs to maintain proliferation despite therapeutic pressure.",

Long non-coding RNAs and regulatory genes (LUCAT1, GFAP isoforms) grouped with epigenetic mechanisms. Signaling molecules were integrated based on demonstrated crosstalk. Multiple genes with limited GBM-specific literature were interpreted through established roles in relevant cell types and processes."
