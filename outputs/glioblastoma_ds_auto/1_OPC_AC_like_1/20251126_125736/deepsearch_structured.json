In triple-negative breast cancers (often PTEN-null), INPP4B loss enhances oncogenic AKT signaling. However, in PIK3CA-mutant ER+ breast cancers, INPP4B functions as an oncogene by promoting Wnt/β-catenin activation through late endosome signaling. This paradoxical function stems from INPP4B's role in converting PI(3,4)P2 to PI(3)P on late endosomes, which recruits ESCRT machinery and facilitates endosomal trafficking of GSK3β for lysosomal degradation, thereby stabilizing β-catenin. This discovery indicates that PI3K pathway regulation is highly context-dependent and that therapeutic targeting requires understanding of specific genomic backgrounds.",

MN1 maintains active chromatin at HOXA cluster genes and their downstream targets including anti-apoptotic BCL2, MCL1, and Survivin. MN1 deletion dramatically impairs MLL-AF9 leukemia proliferation and colony formation in vitro and prevents leukemia initiation in vivo. While MN1's role in glioblastoma is not explicitly characterized in the search results, MN1 high expression in other cancer types suggests it may function similarly to maintain proliferative and survival gene programs in brain tumors.",

Restoration of GPC5 expression inhibits tumor growth by antagonizing Wnt/β-catenin signaling and promoting differentiation.
