LIN28B is an RNA-binding protein that blocks biogenesis of the tumor-suppressive let-7 microRNA family by recruiting Terminal Uridylyl Transferase (ZCCHC11) that polyuridylates and marks pre-let-7 for degradation. By repressing let-7, LIN28B maintains expression of oncogenes including MYC, HMGA2, RAS, and pluripotency factors. This program is particularly relevant in GBM where stemness is associated with treatment resistance and recurrence.",

Each program was validated by evidence that: (1) multiple input genes participate in the same process; (2) the program is relevant to either normal physiology of GBM cell origins or characteristic dysregulations in GBM; (3) multiple independent studies support the gene-program associations; (4) required pathway components are identified, with notation of which are missing from the input list."
