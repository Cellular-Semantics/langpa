Always prioritize recent, authoritative sources and provide specific citations for all major claims.

Generated Prompt:
------------------------------------------------------------
Perform comprehensive literature analysis for the following gene list in the specified biological context.

**Gene List**: ["CCDC92"]

**Biological Context**: obesity

**Analysis Strategy**:
1. Search current scientific literature for functional roles of each gene in the input list
2. Identify clusters of genes that act together in pathways, processes, or cellular states
3. Treat each cluster as a potential gene program within the list
4. Interpret findings in light of both normal physiological roles and disease-specific alterations
5. Prioritize well-established functions with strong literature support, but highlight emerging evidence if contextually relevant.

**Guidelines**:
* Anchor all predictions in either the normal physiology and development of the cell type and tissue specified in the context OR the alterations and dysregulations characteristic of the specified disease
* Connect gene-level roles to program-level implications
* Consider gene interactions, regulatory networks, and pathway dynamics
* Highlight cases where multiple genes collectively strengthen evidence
* Ensure all claims are backed by experimental evidence with proper attribution

**Output**: Respond with JSON conforming to the provided schema - no prose, no markdown. If you are unable to respond with JSON alone, make sure the text includes tables or fragments of schema compliant that unambiguously capture the elements and their associations that would be captured if returning JSON schema.
