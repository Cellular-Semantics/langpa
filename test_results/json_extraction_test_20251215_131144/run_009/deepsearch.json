While CCDC92 is predicted to participate in innate immune response and viral defense mechanisms[2][3], current literature reveals limited direct evidence connecting CCDC92 to obesity-specific pathways. However, when integrated with the broader landscape of obesity-related immune dysregulation, adipose tissue inflammation, and metabolic disturbance, CCDC92 may operate as part of multi-gene programs governing adipose immune infiltration and inflammatory polarization. This analysis reveals that obesity-associated metabolic disease emerges from coordinated dysregulation across multiple biological programs involving adipocyte dysfunction, immune cell activation, iron dysregulation, and lipid metabolism abnormalities. The present investigation identifies three major gene programs relevant to obesity pathophysiology, with particular attention to how these programs manifest in adipose tissue and contribute to systemic metabolic complications.\n\n---\n\n## Biological Context and Analysis Framework\n\n### Context Specification\n- **Cell Type(s)**: Adipocytes (mature and hypertrophic), adipose-resident immune cells (macrophages, CD8+ T cells), endothelial cells\n- **Disease**: Obesity with associated metabolic dysfunction and chronic inflammation\n- **Tissue**: Adipose tissue (visceral and subcutaneous white adipose tissue, with some consideration of browning capacity)\n\n### Input Genes Analyzed\n- CCDC92 (coiled-coil domain containing 92)\n- Obesity-associated chromosome 21-linked genes (in context of metabolic phenotypes)\n\n---\n\n## Foundational Understanding of Obesity Pathophysiology from Contemporary Literature\n\nBefore examining specific gene programs, it is essential to establish the current understanding of obesity as a pathophysiological state. Recent investigations using large-scale multi-omic approaches have fundamentally reshaped our comprehension of how obesity develops and progresses. Integration of plasma proteomic and genomic data from 51,936 participants in the UK Biobank has revealed that aging-related organ dysfunction—a consequence and comorbidity of obesity—involves at least 119 genetic loci, with 27 shared across multiple organs[1][5]. This distributed genetic architecture suggests that obesity represents not a monolithic disease but rather a complex collection of dysregulated pathways operating across tissues and cellular compartments.\n\nThe liver represents a particular nexus of obesity-associated pathology. Through transomic integration combining DNA methylome, transcriptome, proteome, and transcription factor binding data, researchers have demonstrated that obesity impairs hepatic functions through abnormal protein expression patterns associated with DNA methylation and altered transcription factor activity[4]. Specifically, decreased protein expression of complement and coagulation systems was associated with increased DNA methylation together with decreased expression of the transcription factor Hnf4a[4]. This mechanistic insight reveals that obesity-associated pathology emerges through coordinated changes across epigenetic, transcriptional, and proteomic levels.\n\nFrom a population genetics perspective, obesity susceptibility demonstrates substantial variation across ancestral groups. Among Polynesian populations, the rs373863828-A variant in the CREBRF gene represents perhaps the strongest known candidate for a \"thrifty\" variant, showing both strong association with body mass index in Samoans and Tongans and exceptional evidence of recent positive natural selection[6][27][49]. This finding underscores how evolutionary pressures have shaped obesity risk across populations, with implications for understanding whether certain genetic backgrounds predispose populations to metabolic disease under energy-rich environments.\n\n---\n\n## Program 1: Adipocyte-Mediated Immune Activation and Inflammatory Escalation\n\n### Program Description and Biological Significance\n\nThe most extensively characterized obesity-related gene program involves the transformation of mature adipocytes into inflammatory cells capable of orchestrating immune infiltration and polarization within adipose tissue. Recent discovery has unveiled a previously unrecognized role for adipocytes in directly activating adipose-resident CD8+ T cells through β2-microglobulin (B2M)-dependent mechanisms[12][15][17][21][25][29]. This program represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of adipocyte biology, demonstrating that hypertrophic adipocytes function not merely as energy storage depots but as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) capable of triggering adaptive immune responses.\n\nIn obesity, hypertrophic adipocytes experience multiple forms of cellular stress, including hypoxia stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and dysregulation of metabolic pathways such as creatine phosphate/creatine and glutamine metabolism[21]. These stressors trigger coordinated upregulation of immune-related pathways, with gene ontology analysis revealing significant enrichment in 18 distinct immune-related pathways in adipocytes from obese compared to lean mice[12][17]. Notably, analysis of the interaction network of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the top 10 immune-related pathways revealed that the antigen processing and presentation pathway occupied the central position in the network[12][29].\n\nWithin this antigen presentation pathway, two distinct mechanisms have been identified. First, adipocytes were previously known to express major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules and function as APCs for CD4+ T cell activation[12][29]. However, genes associated with MHC-I-related antigen presentation have received limited attention despite their central importance in CD8+ T cell activation[12][29]. Among these MHC-I-related genes, β2-microglobulin (B2M)—a critical chaperone for MHC-I molecule assembly and surface localization—emerges as the key regulatory hub[12][17][25][29].\n\n### Supporting Evidence for the Program\n\nComprehensive validation experiments confirm substantial upregulation of B2M expression at both the messenger RNA and protein levels in the visceral adipose tissue (specifically epigastric white adipose tissue, EpiWAT) from obese mice compared to lean controls[12][17]. Critically, B2M upregulation was observed in mature adipocytes rather than in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), indicating direct dysregulation within adipocytes themselves[12][17]. Immunofluorescence staining further confirmed increased B2M expression in hypertrophic adipocytes from high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice[12][17]. In vitro studies demonstrated dose-dependent increases in both B2M messenger RNA and protein expression in hypertrophic 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid characteristic of Western diets[17].\n\nBioinformatic analysis of human adipose tissue transcriptome data revealed strong correlation between adipose B2M expression and obesity status, with B2M significantly upregulated in adipocytes isolated from patients with obesity[12][15][21][25][29]. This conservation of the dysregulated B2M signature between mouse models and human obesity validates the translational relevance of this program.\n\nThe functional consequences of B2M upregulation in adipocytes are substantial and multifaceted. In adipocyte-specific B2M knockout mice (B2m cKO), HFD feeding resulted in markedly reduced CD8+ T cell activation and expansion compared to control animals, thereby attenuating HFD-induced adipose inflammation[12][15][17][21][25][29]. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) comparing control mice with B2M-deleted adipocytes revealed that pathways involved in T-cell activation, antigen presentation, and inflammatory responses were significantly downregulated[12][15][17]. These data establish B2M as a causal mediator of CD8+ T cell-driven adipose inflammation in obesity.\n\n### Molecular Mechanisms of B2M-Dependent CD8+ T Cell Activation\n\nThe activation of adipose-resident CD8+ T cells by hypertrophic adipocytes occurs through a B2M- and cell contact-dependent mechanism[15][17][21][25][29]. High-fat diet feeding significantly induces upregulation of MHC-I messenger RNA and protein expression in adipocytes, with enhanced localization of MHC-I molecules to the cell membrane[25][29]. Importantly, B2M deficiency abrogates this HFD-induced MHC-I upregulation, although under normal chow diet conditions, B2M deficiency does not significantly affect MHC-I expression levels[25][29].\n\nThese findings suggest that HFD creates a permissive metabolic environment for MHC-I antigen presentation by adipocytes. The requirement for direct cell contact indicates that adipocyte-derived soluble factors alone are insufficient for CD8+ T cell activation; rather, the membrane-proximal interaction between MHC-I molecules on adipocytes and T cell receptors on CD8+ T cells is essential. This contact-dependent activation likely involves additional membrane-associated molecules beyond MHC-I and B2M, though the complete molecular requirement remains to be fully characterized.\n\n### Upstream Cellular Stressors Triggering the Program\n\nThe initiation of this adipocyte-mediated immune activation program appears contingent upon metabolic perturbations characteristic of obesity. Hypertrophic adipocytes experience dysregulation of multiple metabolic pathways including altered creatine phosphate/creatine metabolism and glutamine metabolism[15][17][21]. Additionally, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and hypoxic stress have been documented in expanding adipose tissue[15][17][21].\n\nPalmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid that accumulates in adipose tissue during obesity, drives B2M expression in adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner in vitro[17]. This observation suggests that lipid overload in adipocytes—a hallmark of obesity—serves as a direct trigger for the B2M-dependent immune activation program. The lipid-mediated trigger may operate through metabolic stress sensing pathways, potential ER stress responses, or activation of pattern recognition receptors that respond to lipids.\n\n### Consequences of Program Activation\n\nThe activation of this adipocyte-centered immune program precipitates a cascade of secondary inflammatory events within adipose tissue. Adipose-resident macrophages shift their phenotypic state from the anti-inflammatory M2 state toward the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype, which drives obesity-associated chronic inflammation and metabolic disorders[15][21][25][29]. This phenotypic shift occurs partly through direct interaction with hypertrophic adipocytes and partly through production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by activated CD8+ T cells.\n\nM1-polarized macrophages secrete high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interferon-γ (IFNγ) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which exacerbate adipose tissue inflammation and promote systemic low-grade inflammation via circulation, ultimately contributing to metabolic dysfunction[15][21][25][29]. The amplification loop thus established—whereby adipocyte-derived signals activate CD8+ T cells, which produce cytokines promoting macrophage M1 polarization, which in turn produce additional inflammatory signals—creates a self-sustaining inflammatory state within adipose tissue.\n\n### Atomic Components of the Program\n\n| **Atomic Biological Process** | **Genes Involved** | **Evidence** |\n|------|------|------|\n| MHC-I antigen presentation | B2M, HLA genes | [12][17][25][29] |\n| CD8+ T cell activation | B2M, MHC-I, TCR ligands | [12][15][21][25] |\n| Macrophage polarization to M1 | IL-1β, TNF-α signaling | [15][21][25][29] |\n| Adipocyte inflammatory activation | Multiple pathway DEGs | [12][17][25][29] |\n\n---\n\n## Program 2: Iron Dysregulation and Ferroptosis-Mediated Adipocyte Dysfunction\n\n### Discovery and Characterization of Iron Dysregulation in Obesity\n\nA second major gene program emerging from recent investigations involves dysregulated iron homeostasis within hypertrophic adipocytes. This program represents a convergence point between B2M-dependent antigen presentation and metabolic dysfunction. The B2M gene encodes not only a critical chaperone for MHC-I molecules but also participates in iron uptake and transport pathways through interactions with hereditary hemochromatosis protein (HFE) and transferrin receptors (TFR1 and TFR2)[25][29][38].\n\nComparative proteomic and transcriptomic analysis in HFD-fed mice revealed that the B2m gene represents a critical intersection connecting two major upregulated pathways in obese adipocytes: the antigen processing and presentation pathway and the iron uptake/transport pathway[12][15][17][25][29][38]. This functional positioning of B2M at the nexus of immunity and iron metabolism suggests fundamental coupling between these two processes in obesity pathophysiology.\n\n### Molecular Basis of Iron Dysregulation\n\nThe molecular mechanism underlying iron dysregulation in obesity involves the HFE-TFR1/TFR2-hepcidin-ferroportin (FPN) axis. In lean adipocytes, HFE primarily interacts with transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1), maintaining iron uptake at physiologically appropriate levels[25][29][38]. However, in hypertrophic adipocytes from obese mice, the pattern of HFE interactions shifts dramatically, with predominant HFE-TFR2 interaction replacing HFE-TFR1 interaction[25][29][38]. This shift in interaction partner is of critical functional significance because HFE-TFR2 interaction triggers hepcidin expression through signaling mechanisms, leading to reduced iron efflux[25][29][38].\n\nCrucially, B2M is required for stable membrane localization of HFE and mediates its interactions with both TFR1 and TFR2[25][29][38]. When B2M is absent, as in adipocyte-specific B2M knockout mice, HFE fails to properly localize to the adipocyte membrane and cannot interact with either transferrin receptor, resulting in disrupted iron homeostasis regulation regardless of dietary conditions[25][29][38].\n\nThe functional consequences of HFE-TFR2 predominance and increased hepcidin expression in obese adipocytes include reduced iron efflux and progressive accumulation of intracellular iron[25][29][38]. Compared with lean mice, HFD-fed control mice presented significant increases in intracellular iron storage, reflected in elevated messenger RNA and protein levels of ferritin heavy chain (FTH) and ferritin light chain (FTL), as well as increased total iron content in adipocytes[25][29][38]. These iron accumulation markers were not observed in HFD-fed B2M-deleted adipocytes, confirming that B2M drives the iron storage response to HFD[25][29][38].\n\n### Iron Overload and Ferroptosis\n\nExcessive intracellular iron in adipocytes creates conditions permissive for ferroptotic cell death, an iron-dependent form of regulated necrosis. The accumulated iron catalyzes generation of reactive oxygen species through Fenton chemistry, depletes the antioxidant glutathione, and triggers ferroptosis execution pathways[25][29][38]. Evidence suggests that ferroptosis of adipocytes in obesity promotes M1 polarization of adipose tissue macrophages, as macrophages must infiltrate to clear dying adipocytes and become activated through the process of phagocytosing cell debris[25][29][38].\n\nThis connection between iron overload and macrophage activation represents a previously underappreciated mechanism linking metabolic dysfunction to inflammatory disease. The observation that iron accumulation specifically correlates with ferroptosis-mediated adipocyte death provides mechanistic linkage between iron dysregulation and the observed expansion of pro-inflammatory macrophages in obese adipose tissue.\n\n### Iron Status and Systemic Metabolic Consequences\n\nIndependently of obesity, iron status significantly influences metabolic outcomes. A comprehensive analysis of women of reproductive age in Switzerland revealed that obesity is associated with elevated prevalence of iron deficiency despite paradoxically elevated adipose tissue iron content[35]. This apparent contradiction reflects dysregulation of iron absorption at the intestinal level, potentially mediated by elevated circulating hepcidin induced by inflammatory cytokines in obesity[35].\n\nObesity is fundamentally a state of low-grade systemic inflammation reflected in elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines and adipokines[35]. These inflammatory signals, particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6), upregulate hepcidin production through the JAK-STAT pathway[35]. Hepcidin, the main iron regulatory protein in the human body, binds to ferroportin and causes its internalization and degradation, reducing iron release from enterocytes, macrophages, and hepatocytes into circulation[35][38]. The net result is reduced circulating iron availability despite increased adipose tissue iron content, creating a state of functional iron maldistribution.\n\n### Atomic Components of the Program\n\n| **Atomic Biological Process** | **Genes/Proteins Involved** | **Evidence** |\n|------|------|------|\n| Iron uptake and sensing | HFE, TFR1, TFR2, B2M | [25][29][38] |\n| Hepcidin regulation | IL-6, JAK-STAT pathway | [35][38] |\n| Iron efflux control | Ferroportin (FPN), Hepcidin | [25][29][38] |\n| Ferroptosis execution | Iron-dependent lipid ROS | [25][29][38] |\n| Macrophage recruitment | Ferroptotic adipocyte debris | [25][29] |\n\n---\n\n## Program 3: Dyslipidemia and Altered Adipose Fatty Acid Composition\n\n### Lipid Dysmetabolism in Obesity: The Insulin-Resistant Lipid Phenotype\n\nBeyond adipocyte inflammation and immune activation, obesity manifests profound alterations in lipid metabolism that extend beyond simple triglyceride accumulation. High-resolution metabolomic analysis has revealed distinct lipid phenotypes within obese populations, with particular enrichment of a pro-atherogenic, insulin-resistant profile characterized by specific alterations in lipoprotein composition and fatty acid species[19][28].\n\nThis insulin-resistant lipid phenotype is marked by global triglyceride enrichment across the entire spectrum of lipoproteins—from very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) through high-density lipoprotein (HDL)—accompanied by increases in lipoprotein particle counts[19][28]. Critically, the composition of these lipoproteins becomes pathologically altered: HDL particles in this phenotype are characterized as triglyceride-rich and cholesterol-ester–depleted, representing a dysfunctional state compared to protective HDL particles[19][28]. The fatty acid pool underlying these lipoproteins becomes skewed toward saturated and monounsaturated species with reduced polyunsaturated (ω-6) fractions[19][28].\n\nThis lipid phenotype signature represents a robust clustering independent of obesity severity as measured by body mass index[19][28]. Remarkably, more than one-third of individuals classified as merely \"overweight\" fall into this metabolically high-risk lipid phenotype cluster despite only modest adiposity[19][28]. This observation reveals that conventional anthropometric measures inadequately capture metabolic risk in many individuals, with dyslipidemic predisposition present even at relatively low body weight.\n\n### Molecular Determinants of Altered Fatty Acid Composition\n\nThe altered fatty acid composition characteristic of the insulin-resistant lipid phenotype in obesity likely reflects dysregulation of hepatic lipid handling programs. Evidence from human metabolic studies indicates that enrichment in saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, accompanied by depletion of polyunsaturated species, associates with impaired HDL remodeling and reduced cholesterol-efflux capacity[19][28]. Multiple molecular mechanisms potentially contribute to this altered composition, including dysregulation of desaturase enzymes that convert saturated to polyunsaturated fatty acids, altered activity of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) that mediates lipid exchange between lipoprotein classes, and modified hepatic triglyceride export rates[19][28].\n\nAt the molecular level, these alterations may involve interferon-driven suppression of ABCG1 and ABCA1 cholesterol efflux transporters[19][28]. ABCG1 in particular functions as a key mediator of cholesterol efflux, and its suppression in obesity reduces the capacity of HDL to accept cholesterol from peripheral tissues[19][28][31]. Additionally, hepatic insulin resistance in obesity promotes VLDL overproduction, increasing the flux of triglyceride-rich particles into circulation[19][28]. Putative impaired bile acid-Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling may further contribute to dysregulation of lipid homeostasis[19][28].\n\n### Particular Significance in Down Syndrome with Obesity\n\nThe characterization of the dyslipidemic phenotype becomes particularly illuminating when examined in individuals with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) who also have obesity. Multiple genes on chromosome 21 are known to influence lipid metabolism and inflammatory signaling[8][19][28]. SOD1 (superoxide dismutase 1) increases oxidative stress when overexpressed; APP (amyloid precursor protein) drives amyloid processing; and ABCG1, the key mediator of cholesterol efflux mentioned above, is encoded on chromosome 21[8][19][28].\n\nAdults with Down syndrome exhibit early-onset cardiometabolic complications including accelerated atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes, along with near-universal development of Alzheimer's neuropathology by midlife[8][19][28]. The gene dosage imbalance created by trisomy 21—particularly the overexpression of ABCG1 dosage-sensitivity in the setting of obesity—potentially predisposes individuals to dyslipidemia and metabolic dysfunction[8][19][28], thereby amplifying both cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disease risk[8][19][28].\n\nInvestigation of metabolic phenotypes in African-American children and young adults with Down syndrome and obesity revealed an intrinsic dyslipidemic phenotype independent of obesity severity, characterized by triglyceride-rich, cholesterol-ester–depleted lipoproteins and altered fatty acid composition suggesting insulin-resistant lipid metabolism and impaired lipoprotein remodeling[8][19][28]. The 92-metabolite signature distinguishing high-risk clusters remained significant even when controlling for body mass index classification, indicating that the lipid-handling dysregulation represents an intrinsic feature of Down syndrome metabolism in the obesity context rather than a simple consequence of increased fat mass[19][28].\n\n### Atomic Components of the Program\n\n| **Atomic Biological Process/Molecule** | **Genes/Factors Involved** | **Evidence** |\n|------|------|------|\n| Cholesterol efflux | ABCG1, ABCA1 | [19][28][31] |\n| Hepatic TG export | VLDL assembly factors, MTP | [19][28] |\n| Desaturase activity | Fatty acid desaturases | [19][28] |\n| CETP-mediated lipid exchange | CETP, lipoprotein structures | [19][28] |\n| Bile acid signaling | FXR and downstream effectors | [19][28] |\n| Oxidative stress | SOD1, ROS metabolism | [8][19][28] |\n\n---\n\n## Program 4: Adipokine-Mediated Inflammation and Metabolic Dysregulation Crosstalk\n\n### The Adipokine Network and Its Dysregulation in Obesity\n\nAdipokines represent bioactive signaling molecules secreted by adipose tissue that play crucial roles in regulating energy metabolism and inflammatory responses[16][12][15]. With obesity, the adipokine secretion profile becomes profoundly dysregulated, transforming adipose tissue from an endocrine organ producing primarily protective mediators into a source of pro-inflammatory signals[16][12][15].\n\nLeptin, the archetypal adipokine encoded by the LEP gene, is secreted by white adipocytes into circulation where it plays a major role in regulating energy homeostasis[13][18][45][51]. Under normal conditions, circulating leptin binds to the leptin receptor in the brain, activating downstream signaling pathways that inhibit feeding and promote energy expenditure[51]. However, in obesity, despite markedly elevated circulating leptin levels, individuals demonstrate \"leptin resistance\"—a state where the appetite-suppressive and energy expenditure-promoting effects of leptin become blunted[16].\n\nBeyond leptin, multiple other adipokines become dysregulated in obesity. Pro-inflammatory adipokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) become markedly elevated[16]. These pro-inflammatory adipokines directly contribute to systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction, promoting insulin resistance in liver and skeletal muscle, exacerbating dyslipidemia, and driving atherosclerosis progression[16][24].\n\n### Adipocyte-Macrophage Crosstalk and Inflammatory Amplification\n\nThe dysregulation of adipokine secretion from hypertrophic adipocytes occurs in context of dynamic interactions with adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). Infiltrating monocytes serve as important cellular sources for ATMs, and in obesity, the CC motif chemokine ligand-2/chemokine receptor type 2 (CCL2/CCR2) axis mediates infiltration of circulating monocytes into obese adipose tissue[15][21][25][29]. The combined effect of massive monocyte infiltration and proliferation of resident macrophages contributes to substantial increases in ATM accumulation[15][21][25][29].\n\nAs these accumulating macrophages shift from the anti-inflammatory M2 state toward the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype, they secrete high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines[15][21][25][29]. This creates a self-amplifying inflammatory loop: hypertrophic adipocytes secrete pro-inflammatory adipokines that promote macrophage recruitment and M1 polarization; M1 macrophages reciprocally secrete additional inflammatory cytokines that further stimulate adipocyte inflammatory responses; and activated CD8+ T cells contribute additional pro-inflammatory signals[15][21][25][29].\n\n### Emerging Role of Adipose-Derived MicroRNAs\n\nBeyond classical adipokines, adipose tissue-derived microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as novel paracrine and endocrine signaling molecules capable of modulating distant cellular functions through exosome-mediated transport[16]. These extracellular vesicle-encapsulated miRNAs are increasingly recognized as key regulators in inter-organ communication and disease development[16]. In obesity, the miRNA secretion profile from adipocytes becomes dysregulated, with altered abundance of multiple miRNAs capable of regulating inflammatory and metabolic processes in distant tissues[16].\n\n### Consequences for Systemic Metabolism\n\nThe net consequence of this dysregulated adipokine network is transformation of adipose tissue from a primarily metabolic organ into a source of systemic inflammation driving metabolic disease. Adipokines and adipose-derived inflammatory signals contribute to insulin resistance in liver and skeletal muscle, impaired glucose homeostasis, dyslipidemia, and progression toward type 2 diabetes[16][24]. Additionally, chronic activation of inflammatory pathways in adipose tissue promotes low-grade systemic inflammation visible in elevated circulating C-reactive protein, elevated leukocyte counts, and altered blood pressure regulation[22].\n\n---\n\n## Proteomic Evidence of Adiposity-Related Immune and Metabolic Reprogramming\n\n### Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell Proteomics in Pediatric Obesity\n\nTo understand how obesity-related adipose tissue pathology translates to systemic immune and metabolic dysfunction, recent investigation has examined proteomic alterations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from children and adolescents with varying body composition[22]. This represents an important window into systemic metabolic and immune states, as PBMCs integrate signals from adipose tissue and other metabolic organs.\n\nChildren with increased body fat percentage, as measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), demonstrated statistically significant alterations in PBMC proteome profiles compared to normal weight peers, even after controlling for age, sex, and leukocyte counts[22]. Among the most notable proteomic changes, 31 proteins showed decreased abundance in PBMCs from participants with increased body fat percentage, including B-lymphoid tyrosine kinase (BLK), the delta isoform of the 55 kDa regulatory subunit B of protein phosphatase 2A (2ABD), peroxisomal membrane protein PEX14, and WD repeat-containing protein 81 (WDR81)[22].\n\nConversely, multiple proteins showed increased abundance in PBMCs from children with elevated body fat percentage. Notably, protein sets demonstrating elevated abundance were enriched in molecular functions related to GTPase activity[22], with elevated abundance of proteins including RAB family members (RAB21, RAB34, RAB18, RAB14), Ras-related proteins (RAC2, RAC1), and other small GTPases[22]. These proteins regulate intracellular vesicle trafficking and cell migration, suggesting that obesity-associated systemic changes include enhanced cellular trafficking and migratory capacity in immune cells.\n\n### Oxidative Stress and Leukocyte Activation Signatures\n\nChildren with overweight or obesity and elevated body fat percentage showed increased expression of proteins involved in leukocyte chemotaxis including RAC2 and RAC1[22]. Additionally, elevated expression of thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), a matricellular protein with pro-inflammatory properties, was observed[22]. These proteomic changes collectively suggest that obesity-associated systemic states include upregulated leukocyte trafficking and activation signatures, consistent with the hypothesis that adipose tissue inflammation drives recruitment and activation of circulating immune cells.\n\nThe PBMC proteome alterations also reflect increased oxidative stress in obesity, with upregulation of several mitochondrial proteins including NDUFS7 (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S7), a component of Complex I of the electron transport chain[22]. This observation aligns with extensive prior evidence demonstrating that obesity increases oxidative stress through multiple mechanisms and that oxidative stress contributes causally to obesity-related pathology[22].\n\n---\n\n## CCDC92 in the Context of Obesity-Related Immune Dysregulation\n\n### Limited Direct Evidence but Potential Integration into Immune Programs\n\nHaving established the major gene programs operative in obesity pathophysiology, we can now position CCDC92 within this landscape. CCDC92 is a coiled-coil domain containing protein predicted to have identical protein binding activity and involved in innate immune response and regulation of defense response to virus[2][3]. The gene encodes a protein located on chromosome 12[2][3].\n\nWhile comprehensive direct evidence linking CCDC92 specifically to obesity pathophysiology is limited in current literature, its predicted roles in innate immune response and viral defense suggest potential integration into the broader framework of obesity-associated immune dysregulation. The innate immune system—encompassing pattern recognition receptors, complement activation, and interferon responses—intersects with obesity-related inflammation at multiple points[2][3]. The pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-mediated innate immune response can be triggered by lipids, lipopolysaccharides from dysbiotic microbiota, and damage-associated molecular patterns released from dying adipocytes and hepatocytes[24][26].\n\n### Potential Role in Obesity-Associated Gut Dysbiosis and Immune Training\n\nRecent investigation has revealed important connections between gut microbiota composition, metabolic endotoxemia, and obesity progression[26][50]. High-fat diet feeding alters the composition of gut microbiota, increasing Gram-negative bacteria and their associated lipopolysaccharides[26]. These lipopolysaccharides traverse a compromised intestinal epithelial barrier and trigger TLR4-mediated pattern recognition receptor signaling in innate immune cells and intestinal epithelial cells[24][26].\n\nThe innate immune system's response to altered microbiota composition involves activation of multiple signaling pathways including those governing interferon production[2][3][24]. CCDC92, with its predicted involvement in innate immune response and viral defense, may participate in these pattern recognition receptor-mediated innate immune training responses. Although CCDC92's specific molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated, the protein's coiled-coil domains suggest potential involvement in protein-protein interactions necessary for assembling immune signaling complexes or facilitating receptor clustering and signal amplification.\n\n### Speculative Integration into Macrophage Polarization\n\nAnother potential point of integration involves adipose tissue macrophage polarization and activation. The shift from M2 (anti-inflammatory) to M1 (pro-inflammatory) macrophage phenotype in obesity requires coordinated changes in macrophage transcriptional programs, metabolic reprogramming, and altered responsiveness to microenvironmental signals[15][21][25][29]. Innate immune signaling through pattern recognition receptors—processes in which CCDC92 may participate—represents a key driver of macrophage M1 polarization[15][21][25][29].\n\nPro-inflammatory macrophages require enhanced innate immune signaling capacity relative to anti-inflammatory macrophages, and this likely involves both upregulation of pattern recognition receptor expression and enhanced signal transduction through these receptors[15][21][25][29]. While speculative, CCDC92 may contribute to this macrophage polarization process through enhanced innate immune signaling capacity, though direct experimental evidence remains lacking.\n\n---\n\n## Genetic Predisposition, Population-Level Adaptation, and Lifestyle Modulation\n\n### Polygenic Basis of Obesity Risk and Evidence for Population-Specific Selection\n\nThe genetic architecture of obesity susceptibility demonstrates polygenic inheritance with numerous associated variants identified across populations[6][27][30][49]. However, among the many obesity-associated genetic variants, few show compelling evidence of recent natural selection. The rs373863828-A variant in the CREBRF gene stands out as perhaps the strongest known candidate for a \"thrifty\" variant in Oceanic populations, showing both strong association with BMI in Polynesians and exceptionally strong signal of recent positive selection[6][27][49].\n\nThe \"thrifty gene\" hypothesis proposes that during periods of periodic food scarcity, natural selection favored genetic variants that promoted energy-efficient metabolism and rapid fat accumulation. In resource-limited ancestral environments, such variants would have conferred survival advantage. However, in modern energy-rich environments characteristic of developed and developing nations, these same variants now predispose carriers to obesity and metabolic disease[6][27][49].\n\nEvidence suggests that during the critical period of Pacific island colonization and subsequent settlement, while positive selection was acting on the newly arisen CREBRF variant, allele frequency shifts in multiple pre-existing variants associated with BMI also occurred, possibly reflecting broader genetic changes influencing body composition[6][27][49]. This indicates that obesity susceptibility in Polynesian populations may reflect not a single-gene \"thrifty\" program but rather polygenic adaptation affecting multiple metabolic pathways[6][27][49].\n\n### Modifiable Lifestyle Factors Partially Override Genetic Predisposition\n\nDespite strong genetic predisposition, recent evidence demonstrates that sustained adherence to healthy lifestyle practices can substantially reduce obesity risk even among individuals with high polygenic risk scores (PRS) for BMI[30]. In analysis of 6,663 Indian participants from the UK Biobank and 91 participants from the Wellytics-Asian Institute of Gastroenterology cohort, individuals with high genetic risk but favorable lifestyles—defined by routine physical activity, non-smoking, and adherence to a balanced diet—showed significantly reduced odds of obesity compared to high-risk individuals with unfavorable lifestyles[30].\n\nSpecifically, participants with both high PRS and unfavorable lifestyle showed the greatest odds of obesity (UK Biobank: odds ratio = 3.01, 95% CI 2.92–3.11, P = 8.21 × 10−33; Wellytics cohort: odds ratio = 24.51, 95% CI 23.47–25.56, P = 8.97 × 10−3), whereas those with high genetic risk but favorable lifestyles had substantially reduced odds (UK Biobank: odds ratio = 2.13, 95% CI 2.00–2.25, P = 2.32 × 10−9; Wellytics cohort: odds ratio = 3.92, 95% CI 3.11–4.73, P = 0.19)[30]. These findings suggest that maintaining a healthy lifestyle may help substantially reduce obesity risk even among individuals with strong genetic predisposition, supporting a multifactorial etiology of obesity in which environmental factors remain critical even in genetically susceptible populations.\n\n---\n\n## Systems-Level Integration: From Gene Programs to Tissue and Organism-Level Pathology\n\n### Multi-Tissue Metabolic Dysregulation in Obesity\n\nWhile adipose tissue inflammation and adipocyte dysfunction represent central features of obesity pathophysiology, the metabolic consequences extend far beyond the adipose compartment. Recent transomic analyses integrating DNA methylation, transcriptomic, proteomic, and transcription factor binding data in liver reveal that obesity-associated hepatic dysfunction emerges through coordinated changes across epigenetic, transcriptional, and proteomic levels[4]. Specifically, gene expression changes in the obese liver were more strongly associated with transcription factor (TF) expression changes than with changes in DNA methylation in the promoter region; however, decreased protein expression of complement and coagulation systems in obesity was specifically associated with increased DNA methylation together with decreased expression of the hepatic transcription factor Hnf4a[4].\n\nThis multi-level dysregulation suggests that obesity represents not simply a local dysfunction of adipose tissue but rather a systemic perturbation affecting transcriptional and epigenetic programming across multiple tissues. The liver's role in lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and immune regulation positions hepatic dysfunction as particularly consequential for systemic metabolic outcomes[4].\n\n### Emerging Role of Beige Adipogenesis and Thermogenic Capacity\n\nAn important countervailing process potentially modifying obesity outcomes involves the capacity for white adipocytes to transdifferentiate into thermogenic beige adipocytes. Recent investigation has examined optimization of adipogenic cocktails to enhance brown remodeling of white adipose tissue[47]. Notably, the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)—the master regulator of non-shivering thermogenesis—can be substantially enhanced through specific manipulation of differentiation conditions[47].\n\nAdditionally, emerging evidence suggests that specific microbial metabolites, particularly succinate produced by Prevotella copri, promote browning of inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) through activation of succinate receptor 1 (SUCNR1)[50]. This succinate-mediated browning involves activation of local macrophages and IL-6-STAT3 pathway signaling[50]. These findings suggest that obesity is not an irreversible state but rather a dynamic condition potentially modifiable through metabolic interventions targeting lipid metabolism, immune activation, and thermogenic capacity.\n\n### Endocrine Regulation of Adipose Tissue and Nervous System Integration\n\nThe control of adipose tissue function extends beyond local adipocyte and immune cell dynamics to encompass autonomic nervous system regulation and endocrine signaling. Recent investigation has demonstrated that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-mediated insulin signaling in Phox2B-expressing neurons (a marker of parasympathetic neurons) is essential for regulating autonomic output in peripheral tissues including adipose tissue[42]. This finding reveals intimate neural-metabolic integration, with insulin signaling in specific brainstem neuronal populations directly controlling parasympathetic innervation of adipose tissue and thereby modulating energy expenditure and thermogenic capacity.\n\n---\n\n## Gene Program Summary and Functional Integration\n\nThe preceding analysis has identified four major gene programs operative in obesity pathophysiology, with varying degrees of supporting evidence for the input genes. Below is a structured summary presented in schema-conformant format:\n\n### Program 1: Adipocyte-Mediated CD8+ T Cell Activation and Inflammatory Escalation\n\n**Significance Score**: 0.95\n\n**Supporting Genes**: B2M (β2-microglobulin), MHC-I molecules, associated genes in immune recognition and antigen presentation\n\n**Evidence Summary**: This program is the most robustly characterized in current literature. Multiple independent studies confirm that upregulated β2-microglobulin in hypertrophic adipocytes mediates activation of adipose-resident CD8+ T cells through MHC-I-dependent antigen presentation mechanisms[12][15][17][21][25][29]. Adipocyte-specific B2M deletion substantially attenuates HFD-induced adipose inflammation, establishing causality[12][15][17][21][25][29]. Human bioinformatic analysis confirms B2M upregulation in adipocytes from individuals with obesity[12][15][21][25][29]. This program represents a mechanistic breakthrough in understanding obesity-related inflammation.\n\n**Atomic Biological Processes**:\n- MHC-I antigen presentation: [12][17][25][29]\n- CD8+ T cell activation and expansion: [12][15][21][25]\n- Adipocyte contact-dependent immune activation: [15][17][21][25][29]\n- M1 macrophage polarization: [15][21][25][29]\n\n**Predicted Cellular Impacts**:\n- Enhanced MHC-I surface expression on adipocytes\n- Sustained CD8+ T cell proliferation and cytokine production\n- Recruitment and M1 polarization of adipose tissue macrophages\n- Amplification of systemic low-grade inflammation\n\n---\n\n### Program 2: Iron Dysregulation and Ferroptosis-Mediated Adipocyte Death\n\n**Significance Score**: 0.85\n\n**Supporting Genes**: B2M, HFE (hereditary hemochromatosis protein), TFR1/TFR2 (transferrin receptors), ferroportin, hepcidin regulators, ferroptosis executioners\n\n**Evidence Summary**: This program represents emerging evidence revealing previously unappreciated coupling between iron metabolism and adipocyte inflammatory activation in obesity[25][29][38]. B2M-HFE-TFR interactions mediate HFE-TFR2 predominance in obese adipocytes, leading to increased hepcidin expression and iron accumulation[25][29][38]. Iron overload facilitates ferroptosis of adipocytes, potentially driving macrophage infiltration and M1 polarization[25][29][38]. Adipocyte-specific B2M deletion prevents iron accumulation[25][29][38]. This mechanistic insight reveals fundamental coupling between immunity and metabolic iron handling.\n\n**Atomic Biological Processes**:\n- Iron sensing and HFE-TFR interaction switching: [25][29][38]\n- Hepcidin upregulation and ferroportin degradation: [25][29][38]\n- Intracellular iron accumulation and ferroptosis: [25][29][38]\n- Macrophage recruitment to ferroptotic adipocytes: [25][29]\n\n**Predicted Cellular Impacts**:\n- Progressive intracellular iron accumulation in hypertrophic adipocytes\n- Enhanced ferroptotic cell death\n- Macrophage infiltration to clear dying adipocytes\n- Shifted iron distribution: tissue accumulation despite systemic iron bioavailability reduction\n\n---\n\n### Program 3: Dyslipidemia and Altered Fatty Acid Composition\n\n**Significance Score**: 0.80\n\n**Supporting Genes**: ABCG1, ABCA1, CETP, cholesterol biosynthesis genes, desaturase genes, VLDL assembly factors, chromosome 21-linked genes (SOD1, APP, ABCG1)\n\n**Evidence Summary**: High-resolution metabolomic profiling identifies a robust, obesity-independent dyslipidemic phenotype characterized by triglyceride-rich, cholesterol-depleted lipoproteins and altered fatty acid composition[19][28]. This phenotype segregates from simple obesity-related triglyceride accumulation and reflects dysregulation of specific lipid-handling pathways[19][28]. Gene dosage imbalance in Down syndrome (chromosome 21 trisomy) particularly affects ABCG1 and other lipid metabolism genes, resulting in exacerbated dyslipidemia when combined with obesity[8][19][28]. The metabolomic signature identifies specific lipid and fatty acid pathways offering novel therapeutic targets[19][28].\n\n**Atomic Biological Processes**:\n- Cholesterol efflux capacity: [19][28][31]\n- Hepatic VLDL production and export: [19][28]\n- Fatty acid desaturation and polyunsaturated fat synthesis: [19][28]\n- CETP-mediated lipoprotein remodeling: [19][28]\n- Oxidative stress from SOD1 dysregulation: [8][19][28]\n\n**Predicted Cellular Impacts**:\n- Impaired reverse cholesterol transport\n- Heightened hepatic triglyceride synthesis and export\n- Reduced polyunsaturated fatty acid composition in lipoproteins\n- Enhanced atherosclerotic lipoprotein formation\n- Amplified oxidative stress in Down syndrome context\n\n---\n\n### Program 4: Adipokine-Mediated Inflammation and Metabolic Dysregulation Crosstalk\n\n**Significance Score**: 0.85\n\n**Supporting Genes**: LEP (leptin), TNF (TNF-α), IL6 (IL-6), CCL2/CCR2 axis, adiponectin, resistin, additional adipokine regulatory factors\n\n**Evidence Summary**: Dysregulated adipokine secretion from hypertrophic adipocytes represents a major driver of obesity-related systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction[12][15][16][21]. Pro-inflammatory adipokines (TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1) increase substantially in obesity, contributing to insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and atherosclerosis[16][24]. Leptin resistance develops despite markedly elevated circulating leptin[16]. Emerging evidence highlights adipose-derived miRNAs as novel paracrine signaling molecules regulating distant tissue metabolism[16]. The adipokine network drives recruitment and M1 polarization of adipose tissue macrophages through CCL2/CCR2 signaling[15][21][25][29].\n\n**Atomic Biological Processes**:\n- Leptin signaling and appetite control: [13][18][45][51]\n- TNF-α and IL-6 pro-inflammatory signaling: [16][24]\n- Chemokine-mediated macrophage recruitment: [15][21][25][29]\n- Adipokine-mediated hepatic and muscular insulin resistance: [16][24]\n- Adipose-derived miRNA paracrine signaling: [16]\n\n**Predicted Cellular Impacts**:\n- Systemic insulin resistance and impaired glucose homeostasis\n- Dyslipidemia progression\n- Accelerated atherosclerosis\n- Enhanced circulating inflammatory markers (CRP, leukocyte counts)\n- Altered blood pressure regulation\n- Systemic low-grade inflammation affecting multiple tissues\n\n---\n\n## Positioning CCDC92 Within Obesity Pathophysiology\n\n### Assessment of Current Evidence\n\nCCDC92's predicted involvement in innate immune response and viral defense positioning[2][3] suggests potential integration into the complex landscape of obesity-related immune dysregulation. However, direct experimental evidence linking CCDC92 to specific obesity-related pathways remains limited in current literature. The protein's coiled-coil domain structure suggests involvement in protein-protein interactions potentially critical for assembling signaling complexes or clustering of surface receptors[2][3].\n\n### Plausible Integration Points\n\n**Point 1: Pattern Recognition Receptor Signaling**\nCCDC92 may participate in pattern recognition receptor-mediated innate immune responses triggered by lipopolysaccharides from dysbiotic microbiota and damage-associated molecular patterns released in obesity[2][3][24][26]. Enhanced PPR signaling capacity could contribute to the exaggerated innate immune activation characteristic of obesity.\n\n**Point 2: Macrophage Polarization**\nThe shift from M2 to M1 macrophage phenotype in obesity requires coordinated transcriptional and signaling changes. CCDC92's predicted innate immune functions may support macrophage M1 polarization through enhanced pattern recognition receptor responsiveness[2][3][15][21][25][29].\n\n**Point 3: Endothelial and Epithelial Barrier Function**\nBeyond immune cells, the protein's involvement in innate immune responses may reflect roles in maintaining epithelial and endothelial barrier integrity. Obesity-associated impaired intestinal barrier function enables increased lipopolysaccharide translocation[24][26]. CCDC92 may participate in maintaining these barrier functions, with dysregulation contributing to metabolic endotoxemia.\n\n### Required Future Investigation\n\nTo definitively establish CCDC92's role in obesity pathophysiology, the following investigations appear necessary: (1) comprehensive characterization of CCDC92 protein structure and identification of binding partners; (2) examination of CCDC92 expression patterns across immune cell types and tissues relevant to obesity; (3) functional assessment of CCDC92 in obesity models, including both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches; (4) mechanistic dissection of CCDC92's role in pattern recognition receptor signaling and immune cell activation.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: Multi-Level Gene Program Architecture of Obesity Pathophysiology\n\nThe comprehensive analysis presented herein reveals obesity to emerge from coordinated dysregulation across multiple interconnected gene programs, each operating at distinct cellular and tissue levels yet collectively driving the systemic metabolic disease characteristic of obesity. The four major programs identified—adipocyte-mediated CD8+ T cell activation, iron dysregulation and ferroptosis, dyslipidemia with altered fatty acid composition, and adipokine-mediated inflammation—each contribute quantifiable impacts to obesity pathophysiology with varying levels of mechanistic understanding.\n\nThe most robustly characterized program involves adipocyte-mediated CD8+ T cell activation through β2-microglobulin-dependent mechanisms, representing a genuine mechanistic breakthrough in obesity research. This program has transitioned from discovery to experimental validation to human translational evidence, establishing a solid evidentiary foundation. The iron dysregulation program, while more recently characterized, demonstrates similar mechanistic clarity with substantial supporting experimental evidence. The dyslipidemia program, defined through high-resolution metabolomic approaches, provides unbiased evidence of specific lipid pathway dysregulation relevant to cardiometabolic risk. The adipokine-mediated inflammation program represents well-established pathophysiology with emerging evidence regarding novel adipose-derived signaling molecules.\n\nCCDC92, while currently lacking direct experimental characterization in obesity contexts, possesses predicted functional properties—involvement in innate immune response and potentially protein-protein interaction mediated through coiled-coil domains—suggesting integration into the broader framework of obesity-related immune dysregulation. The protein's potential roles in pattern recognition receptor signaling, macrophage polarization, and barrier function maintenance represent plausible integration points, though these remain speculative pending direct experimental investigation.\n\nThe findings that sustained adherence to healthy lifestyle practices can substantially reduce obesity risk despite strong genetic predisposition[30] provides important context for understanding obesity as a fundamentally modifiable disease state. While genetic architecture substantially influences obesity susceptibility, environmental factors—particularly physical activity, dietary composition, and smoking status—retain critical regulatory influence even in genetically susceptible individuals. This multifactorial etiology suggests that optimal therapeutic approaches will require interventions targeting multiple gene programs simultaneously, potentially through combined pharmacological, behavioral, and microbiota-directed approaches.\n\nFuture research directions should prioritize: (1) comprehensive characterization of CCDC92 and other insufficiently studied genes in obesity contexts; (2) investigation of gene-gene interactions between the multiple programs identified; (3) development of therapeutic strategies targeting specific programs either individually or in combination; (4) elucidation of how environmental factors (diet, physical activity, microbiota) modulate these gene programs; (5) assessment of whether specific gene program dysregulation patterns stratify obesity patients into clinically meaningful subtypes requiring personalized therapeutic approaches.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\nThe analysis presented here integrates findings from 51 peer-reviewed scientific publications and comprehensive genomic resources indexed in the search results provided, with all major claims supported by specific citations to these sources as indicated throughout the report using bracketed reference numbers.",
